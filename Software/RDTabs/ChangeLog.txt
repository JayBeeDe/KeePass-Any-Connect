RD Tabs ChangeLog
-----------------

3.0.11
------
- Fixed bug: RD Tabs prevented importing favorites from exports created in 2.1.x.  It should have let it go through with only a warning and not a hard block.

3.0.10
------
- Fixed bug: an arithmetic overflow was possible under certain conditions when closing a tab.
- Fixed bug: various DPI display issues when running in native high DPI mode on a system with a high DPI display.

3.0.9
-----
- Fixed bug: when reconnecting after network interruption, sometimes the connecting spinner animation would not stop after the connection was reestablished.
- Added additional diagnostic information to crash error reports and included a short walkthrough message on how to repair a corrupt installation when it's detected in certain scenarios that have been reported by at least two users upgrading from 2.x RD Tabs.

3.0.8
-----
- Fixed bug: for new installations that were not upgrading from previous RD Tabs, you would be unable to move favorites to new folders.  Also, renaming a folder may have caused favorites to get moved to the root folder.  This did not affect any user upgrading from a previous RD Tabs version.
- Added more debug tracing for when exceptions occur during app start and tab initialization.
- Added a missing connection error code.
- Fixed bug: when cancelling a reconnection attempt using the MS built-in autoreconnector, the tab state could get out of sync and not work correctly after disconnecting.
- Workaround: identified an edge case bug in the RDP control where sometimes when attempting to connect after a series of network issues on some network cards, the RDP control will crash.  RD Tabs now captures this occurance as recoverable and destroys the offending tab cleanly without crashing RD Tabs.
- Improved code around disconnection to speed it up in some cases.
- Fixed bug: when disconnecting, you switched to another tab and back, you'd see a black screen rather than the "disconnecting..." message.
- Fixed bug: if your favorite opening link behavior was set to only use the active tab when the tab was not connecting/connected, if the tab was reconnecting it would still incorrectly be used.
- Fixed bug: if your favorite opening link behavior was set to use the existing tab even if connecting/connected, and you opened a new favorite while a connection warning dialog was open, the tab would behave unpredictably.  Now the new connection attempt will be ignored until the dialog is dismissed.

3.0.7
-----
- Upgraded the WiX toolkit to the latest bits which seems to have fixed an installer issue at least one user was having.
- Added the ability to log advanced debugging information to a file for troubleshooting.
- Fixed bug: The Most Recently Used (MRU) computer list in the computer combo box wasn't working.
- Fixed bug: When importing favorites from an RDTSF file, passwords would not decrypt correctly, thus they would be blanked out.  The passwords are stored correctly in the RDTSF file, so if you have existing exports, you can use them.
- Fixed bug: For the configuration history, on startup if a history file was locked for some reason during file rotation, RD Tabs would crash.  RD Tabs now soft-fails and continues to load.
- Added "Toggle Full Screen" to the task tray icon context menu.
- Added missing connection error codes.
- Fixed bug: When tabs overflow the tab bar and require scrolling, sometimes when you clicked a tab just out of view, it would jump the scroll position very far from where it should be.
- Fixed bug: When the right most tab is in focus, part of the tab and the "new tab" tab would be out of view.
- Fixed bug: Certain scenarios, such as redirected appdata folders, could result in RD Tabs not correctly finding and loading configuration on launch leading to an application crash.
- Fixed bug: When the main RD Tabs window was moved, but not resized, the new location was not saved, so the application would not restore in the right spot upon subsequent launch.
- Fixed bug: The error reporter was not correctly detecting if the system was 64bit.
- Tweaked the way RD Tabs responds to some DPI change events for when DPI changes occur dynamically (this is not completely done, but just a step along the way).  This is only applicable when RD Tabs is set to handle native DPI.
- Tweaked the RD Gateway username/domain UI elements to match behavior of the main username/domain UI elements.
- RD Gateway authentication type text changed from "select later" to "auto" to more clearly reflect how gateways currently work.
- Added a flag to note whether a submitted error report was generated by a recoverable error or not (allows me to know if the user experienced an app crash or a recovery).
- Fixed bug: SysKey+F11 was not toggling full screen mode correctly, it instead flickered through a few different views before returning back to normal.
- Fixed bug: SysKey+F2 would freeze due to a race condition in certain situations.
- Fixed bug: SysKeys would not work if you were connected to a remote session where the Windows Combination keys were sent to the remote session.  This was due to a regresion introduced when the behavior of the menu bar hiding changed.
- Fixed bug: SysKey+F10 would collapse immediately after showing the menu.
- When you engage a SysKey and the menu bar is hiden, the menu bar will temporarily unhide.  This enables several of the above SysKey fixes.  It also allows you to see the SysKey indicator.
- For Windows 8 and newer clients (RDP 8.0), you can now specify a remote resolution of up to 8192x8192.  Use this in conjunction with DPI aware mode and 4K monitors are fully supported without scaling.
- Tweaked password encryption for performance.  These changes cause RD Tabs 3.0.0 to 3.0.6 to be unable to decrypt passwords saved in 3.0.7.  So if you downgrade RD Tabs from 3.0.7 to earlier, your passwords will be lost.  Cryptographic strength is equal between versions, this is merely a performance enhancement based on how passwords are saved.
- RTM!  Beta is complete.

3.0.6 (Beta)
-------------
- Fixed bug: when tabs were hidden, the remote desktop height was calculated incorrectly causing the desktop to not be as large as it should be.
- Fixed bug: when remote desktop gateway was enabled, an error would occur that said "Conversion from string to type Double is invalid" when you tried to connect.
- Changed some default settings.
- RD Tabs Update nags a little bit more now.  I found that in Windows 10, my testers weren't seeing the update notification since Windows more aggressively hides Task Tray icons.  So now it "toasts" once per hour or when you unlock the computer.
- Fixed bug: after disconnecting and returning to the connection properties dialog, if you resized the RD Tabs window, scrollbars would appear inside the tab and then disappear and reappear sporadically while resizing.
- Reduced flicker when switching tabs.
- Tab Windows full screen and menu behavior is now the same as the main RD Tabs window.
- Fixed a bug in the window resizing for the profile cleanup utility.
- Splash screen now has the full version number, including patch level and build number.
- All occurences of "Avian Waves" have been replaced with "Avian Waves LLC" to reflect the name of the company and correct current copyright information.
- Added the rest of the missing icons and updated a few others.
- Tweaked a bunch of UI elements and text strings.
- Fixed a few display bugs in the PowerShell Prompt.
- Fixed bug: the window position was not being saved between executions of RD Tabs.
- Changed some text so that terminology matches throughout the application.
- Fixed some scaling issues.
- The error icon is back when there is a problem connecting to a remote session.
- Fixed bug: The "After Connected" script could still continue to run after the remote desktop session was ended.
- Fixed bug: some of the automation methods in the PowerShell $RDTabs.Automation object were not working correctly.
- Fixed bug: added bounds checking to $RDTabs.Automation.ScreenCaptureRemoteDesktopRegionToClipboard().
- Added CTRL+A shortcut to the script editor for selecting all text.
- Fixed bug: RD Tabs would notify an update is available even after the update was installed due to some invalid update readiness caching.
- Documentation fully updated.
- This release is ready for public beta!  Let the veil be lifted!

3.0.5 (Alpha)
-------------
- Fixed bug: there were rare instances where RD Tabs would not correctly remember it's window location after closing and relaunching, particularly if you have an odd multi-monitor layout (L-shape, for example).  New window layout validation code now uses each individual monitor position reported by Windows.
- Fixed bug: desktop scaling would not be honored (would revert to unscaled) in certain scenarios when using split screen (send to new pane).
- Improved performance: When resizing the RD Tabs window, the remote desktop resizing now performs faster.
- Changed behavior: The option "Open favorite in a new tab only if the active tab is connected, otherwise use the active tab" has been changed to "Open favorite in a new tab only if the active tab is connected [or connecting], otherwise use the active tab."  This is a subtle change, but I've found that it's really annoying when you are trying to open many tabs quickly in succession for it to reuse the same time while the tab is in the connecting state.  This also affects the "has ever connected" option underneath it.
- Minor tweak: The resolution section of the connection bar now updates live values if the connection is set to one of the "Fit to" options.
- Changed behavior: If RD Tabs is open, connected to a remote tab, and the warning is enabled, it will ask if you are sure you want to exit.  It did this even if Windows was shutting down, which is against Microsoft usability guidelines.  RD Tabs now is compliant with the usability guidelines and will exit gracefully without prompting during a shutdown situation even with warnings enabled.  If you had to select the "end task now" option from the shutdown warning screen, RD Tabs would not exit gracefully and may have been at risk for losing settings.
- Fixed bug: sometimes the window size wouldn't save when exiting the application.
- Changed behavior: Script execution errors are now logged to the connection history.  Scripts that are missing are no longer "hidden" from the user, so you will get appropriate errors in the connection history and "before connecting" scripts will now block the connection, if configured to stop on error.  Simply remove the missing script to fix.  This will only happen if you create a script add it to a favorite, then delete the script without removing the reference in the favorite.
- Finished wiring up the PowerShell RemoteDesktopConnectionProperties object.  There is now a "Factory" property of the automatic variable $RDTabs that lets you get empty RemoteDesktopConnectionProperties objects and you can fully control all of the properties for creating new tabs in the automation scenario.  This is also potentially useful during executing context.  There is still no access to favorites.  That will come in a later version.  CreateRDPTab() has a TON of overloads.  To see them all, just run the method name without the parenthesis, like $RDTabs.Automation.CreateRDPTab.
- Fixed bug: Some PowerShell CreateRDPTab() methods were wired up incorrectly so if you tried to pass in a server name directly, for example, it wouldn't work.
- Exporting and importing of scripts is now possible.  Scripts will export to a file type called RDTSX (RD Tabs Secure Export).  This is a new container file type that will eventually supercede RDTSF (secure favorites export) and RDTAS (application settings) as well.  The idea is that the new file format which makes use of the SecurityDriven.Inferno library for enhanced security.  Like RDTSF, it uses AES-256 for encryption, but uses modern strong key derivation.  Since it uses a container format, all types of RD Tabs exportable data can be stored within it, allowing a full export of your entire RD Tabs setup, so you can more easily set up new computers or share data.  For favorites with scripts, this will be especially helpful since the script can be contained with the favorite.  But I'm getting ahead of myself.  Right now, it's only good for scripts.  Look for the rest in a future release.  :-)
- Fixed bug: If the redial counter was counting down and you closed a tab, in some situations the application would crash due to a timer not getting reset on the RDP control.
- Fixed bug: automatic recovery from non-fatal errors in the RDP control (introduced in 3.0.0) has had several bugs fixed that prevented errors from being recovered in certain cases, the application would simply crash as in older versions.
- .Net Version Change: Switched from 4.5 to 4.5.2 (which you should be on anyway!).
- All RD Tabs assemblies are now digitally signed (Authenticode), including the installer.  You can now be assured that the RD Tabs installer you get is valid by looking to see if it's signed by Avian Waves LLC.
- RD Tabs Setup has been rebuilt and now uses WiX instead of the old legacy Setup Project.  Because of this, RD Tabs now has a very simple single universal installer, rather than seperate x86 and x64 installers.  The installer has most of its logic in the EXE "bootstrap" setup file.  Inside this are two MSIs for the x64 and x86 version.  Silent installations can be performed using command line parameters /install /quiet.  It's not recommended, but if you need to install from then MSIs, you can extract them using the dark.exe utility that comes with the free WiX toolkit.  Remember that doing a silent install or MSI extraction is the same as clicking "accept" on the click-wrap of the interactive installer and you are bound by the same licensing terms therein.
- The EULA has been updated.  The language has been clarified greatly, and new sections are in place to describe licensing for when Premium Features are offered in the future.
- Fixed bug: scroll wheel tab scrolling on overflow had the direction reversed.  Possible regression.
- Changed behavior: Tabs now snap automatically when the window is resized so that the tabs are not off the screen if there is room for them to be on the screen.
- Fixed links in the Help menu.
- Included more details in About screen.
- You can now hide the tabs bar for additional vertical screen real estate.  Select "Show/Hide Tabs Bar" in the Connection menu or press CTRL+F12.  This might seem weird at first, but maybe you want to only run a single tab in a particular Tab Window plus you can also still switch tabs in the Tabs menu, the Quick View or using keyboard shortcuts.

3.0.4 (Alpha)
-------------
- Fixed the error report URL for Remote Computer Information to always use SSL.
- When you open a favorite, but choose not to connect to it immediately, RD Tabs will now populate the title bar with the favorite name.  Previously it would say "New Connection."
- Updated the Remote Desktop interop DLLs to support the latest Windows 10 Creators version.
- Fixed bug: connection history was not being maintained when a new favorite was opened in an existing tab.
- Connection History now supports sorting on any column.
- Connection History default sort order is now timestamp descending (same as Windows Event Viewer).
- Tweaked the update notifications.  There's now a dedicated task tray icon for new updates and an easier to read notification link in the application window.  This will make it a lot more clear, I hope.
- The remote computer information and profile cleaner utilities now scale to DPI using the Windows compatibilty shim as their default setting for high DPI monitors.
- Profile cleaner tool now includes all the history and backup files of the new 3.0+ settings system.  So if you want to delete those, you can do that easily with this tool.
- Remote Computer Info has had it's internal state tracking converted to the new settings format, so there is no longer an associated user.config file that can cause problems.
- Remote Computer Info had a few code paths that wouldn't be caught by the error reporting system.  It now fully routes all exceptions correctly.

3.0.3 (Alpha)
-------------
- Tweaked the color theme a bit for better contrast on different displays.
- Added an option to clear the tab cache.  It's located in the "about" menu, where you can see the tab cache usage.  Under normal circumstances, this isn't necessary.  But it may be useful for debugging or in the odd rare case a tab crashes and gets put back into the cache after crashing.
- Fixed bug: when in full screen mode, if you tried to open Options or Manage Favorites, the window closed immediately after opening.
- Windows 8/8.1/10 high DPI monitors are now supported for native resolution (Surface devices, 4K monitors).  You can change this in the setting.  This may not be desired for most since remote desktops that you connect to may cause everything to be very tiny, so having Windows automatically upscale is the default setting.
- More disconnection codes have been added.
- Domains longer than 16 characters (old NetBIOS limit) has been increased to support any length.
- Fixed bug: certain UI control limits (like manually specific maximum resolution) would get pinned to the wrong RDP version's max/min limit when switching tabs.
- Fixed bug: when a tab automatically reconnects (for example due to network disturbances) the connecting state would show as "connected" after several seconds even if the connection was not reestablished.
- Refactored some code on how connection states are tracked - this may or may not help with rare instances of tabs getting "stuck."
- Added code to detect a tab that might be in a bad state either due to the underlying RDP control going into a bad state or RD Tabs code itself, this allows RD Tabs to avoid caching the tab and causing problems later on.
- Fixed bug: window scaling options were not updating correctly when first loading from a favorite.
- Changed the connected icon color to green instead of cyan.  Seems to make more visual sense to me.
- Exporting favorites has been fixed.
- You can no longer export passwords with the XML file type.  It's just too dangerous and easy to accidentally do.  Use RDTSF!
- Numerous bugs in Remote Computer Information have been fixed for Windows 8/8.1/10+ systems.  This mostly affected 64-bit RD Tabs, but may have affected 32-bit in some cases too.
- The favorites editor now correctly works with all the new properties, including script selection.
- The batch favorites editor now includes all new properties and allows more flexible editing of some older properties.
- The versioning of RD Tabs has changed slightly.  The scheme I'm going with is: Major.Minor.Patch.Build.  So the fourth version segment is used now and it's just a static running counter of each build.  This isn't really used for end users as much as for test versions so I can compare DLL versions when working on minor revisions and patches.  You'll see the change in the Help->About menu, though.
- RD Tabs now uses universal EXEs and DLLs for x64 and x86 platforms both.  However, due to limitations in the MSI installer format, there are still two installers for each CPU, but they install the exact same files.  This redesign though should help with future development as there will only be a single machine type to compile to.

3.0.2 (Alpha)
-------------
- Fixed bug: Sometimes the menu wouldn't hide when the mouse lost focus in fullscreen.
- Fixed bug: Occasionally a connection would be black or gray initially after connecting until the window was resized or connection was disconnected and reconnected.
- Added disconnection code 4360.
- Fixed bug: Some non-error disconnection codes were showing as an error.
- Fixed bug: redial / reconnect had numerous regression issues due to code refactoring.  This should all be fixed.
- Fixed bug: buttons would get stuck in the "highlighting" color after clicked if the button was then disabled, like clicking the reconnect button.
- Export / Import settings has been implemented with the new application settings.  It should be backward compatible with all previous RD Tabs version for importing.  However, exporting will not work completely from newer versions to older versions.  Use at your own risk for going from new (3.x) to old (2.x).
- Fixed bug: the first tab opened would have connection properties restricted incorrectly to the lowest version RDP, rather than using the actual version discovered and initialized.  This also applied to Default Connection Properties.
- Fixed bug: if you clicked reconnect REALLY quickly after disconnecting, sometimes it would disconnect while reconnecting (race condition).

3.0.1 (Alpha)
-------------
- Fixed bug: Favorites menu didn't work in 3.0.0 in secondary tab windows.
- Fixed bug: Automatically hiding the menu bar when entering full screen mode would toggle when you hid or unhid the menu bar.
- Fixed bug: On secondary monitors, the menu bar would flicker open and closed if it was hidden while in full screen mode.
- Fixed bug: If you exited RD Tabs after toggling into and out of full screen mode, it would always attempt full screen mode when you open it again.
- Fixed bug: Normal/restore window dimensions were not correctly saved when maximizing or going into full screen.
- Fixed bug: Settings were not saved if you exited RD Tabs using the Alt+F4 shortcut key instead of clicking on the "X" button.
- Fixed bug: The installer was having issues in some cases reporting a "DLL error."
- Tweaked some settings in the installer that may have been causing issues.
- New: hidden menu in full screen mode now "floats" over the tabs instead of pushing them down.  This is the more expected behavior and also resolves issues calculating the desktop size when using an automatic size mode.

3.0.0 (Alpha)
-------------
- Due to internal refactoring, new features, and performance, RD Tabs now requires a minimum of Windows Vista or Windows Server 2008 with the .Net Framework 4.5 (or newer) installed.  It may still run on earlier versions of Windows, but it is no longer supported.
- Changed Default: The "new tab" tab on the right side of the tab list is now the default tab creation style.  This more closely aligns RD Tabs with the style of other TDI applications.  This is only effective for NEW RD Tabs installations and is reconfigurable.
- Changed behavior: Cancelling a connection will no longer remove the computer from the MRU list if you have the option set to remove "bad" connections from the MRU list.
- New eye candy: The connecting, reconnecting, redialing, and disconnecting graphics/dialogs have all been changed.  No big functionality difference - I just wanted to make it look slicker. :-)
- New visual style: Changed the tabs to look more modern.
- Smaller footprint: The new eye candy uses the "lightweight controls" library I developed for RD Tabs, so the tab is slightly less of a resource hog now. :-)
- Most of the connection properties chrome was removed to make RD Tabs look more modern.
- The embedded "change display name" dialog has been changed from the orange sherbert theme to the standard windows Control colors with a thick black border so it doesn't look like it's a part of the desktop.
- Changed default: The default maximum size of the MRU list has been increased to 50 entries (previously 20).  This is configurable, obviously.
- New feature: You can now choose between using the RD Tabs auto-reconnector (from 2.1) or the built-in Microsoft auto-reconnector (same as MSTSC).  There are situations where the Microsoft one may be preferrable.  For example, it can retain connection state, so that you can reconnect under bad network conditions without having to type in your username/password ahead of time.  Note that reconnection parameters cannot be set in the Microsoft mode.  The maximum attempts is 20 and the time between attempts is approximately 5 seconds.
- Fixed a minor visual bug where some colors on buttons would not set to the default Windows "control" color when operating in a non-skinned visual mode (as in the basic Windows visual mode that is not XP "Luna" or Vista's Aero)
- The tab icon (which represents connection state) is now visible in the Tabs menu.  So if you use the Tabs menu to switch between tabs, you will now be able to see connection state in that menu.
- New feature: Connection history.  You can now view a list of connection attempts and disconnection reasons of each tab in a list. 
- The password dialog for encrypting export files now has an indicator telling you how complex your password is.  It also confirms that you want to use the password you entered if the password is weak.  The algorithm to determine complexity is a bit involved, but it basically revolves around using many different characters sets (letters, numbers, punctuation) while also taking length into consideration since lengthy passwords without a diverse set of characters are still strong passwords.  It also "punishes" passwords that are largely made up of just a few different characters.  It does not use a dictionary, so it doesn't know if you are using common words that might make your password easier to guess.  Still, I think it's pretty useful.
- Smaller footprint: decoupled several large controls from each individual tab and converted it into a shared control.  This drastically reduced the footprint of each individual tab.
- New option: Under "experience" in the connection properties, you can now specify if the tab will suspend its network traffic when it is hidden (the optimization made in 2.1.7).  There are cases where this optimization does not improve network performance since a full screen redraw is required when the tab is switched back to.  Now you have the option to choose for each individual tab.  The default value is that network traffic is NOT suspended when hidden (the behavior of RD Tabs versions prior to 2.1.7).
- Fixed a bug where custom DPI would cause RD Tabs to malfunction in strange ways.
- Better UI: There is no longer a modal dialog before batch editing favorites asking you if you want to apply the changes recursively.  Instead, it has a checkbox at the bottom of the editor allowing you to make changes only to a single folder deep or recursively.  This is a much less intrusive experience for the user.  Default is to apply changes recursively.
- Added better feature detection into the RDP initialization to catch situations where certain features are not supported so we can automatically fail back to an older RDP version.
- Replaced the buggy Connection Thumbnail Selector with what is now called the Tab Quick View.  It improves on the thumbnail selector in the following ways: thumbnails are now live views of your connections and updated in real time and each tab window has its own Quick View, rather than just the one in the main program window.
- Added a new recovery feature where if certain non-fatal occurs occur within a tab, RD Tabs is able to close the tab, discard it, and continue operating without exiting the program.  As time goes on, the number of recoverable errors will grow.  Unfortunately, not all tab-level errors are non-fatal, so some tab-level crashes will still crash the entire application.
- RD Tabs no longer includes a bundled RDP 6.0 control (which was distributed with permission from Microsoft).  Since the RDP Control is distributed through Windows Update now since the release of Windows Vista and Windows XP SP3, it is simply no longer needed.  RD Tabs will inform you of a download link if you run the self-repair utility and are missing the library.
- EULA has changed slightly for clarity.
- RD Tabs no longer uses the .Net user.config system to store settings.  It now uses its own system.  You can continue to use the Profile Cleaner to cleanup residual garbage from previous versions and also settings history from the new system.  Settings files are now stored in the roaming user profile appdata under the "Avian Waves\RD Tabs" folder.
- Several dialogs have been updated for screen size issues and workflow consistency.
- All graphics and icons have been redesigned based on my take on Microsoft's "Modern" UI paradigm.  I tried not to go too overboard and make it all bland and gray.  I hope you like it.  There are no public domain icons in use in RD Tabs any longer.  It's all original.
- The RD Tabs application icon and splash screen are both brand new.  It should be unique enough to be recognizable without confusing with the Microsoft Remote Desktop iconography, while still giving a nod to the iconography used in Windows 8, so you can tell it's a remote desktop app and not something else.
- Fixed an issue where on Windows 7 and newer systems, RD Tabs was not able to launch the TS Admin app that comes with windows (under Tools menu).  Reworked this code a bit too to help with elevation issues when using RD Tabs 32-bit on a 64-bit system.
- The "single instance" code has been rewritten.  The built-in .Net single instance enforcement has a few strange bugs that can cause RD Tabs to crash.  Most notably, if you are running RD Tabs and then "Run As" RD Tabs as another user, it will crash.
- Updated support for the Windows 8.1 RDP library version.
- UI improvement on the toolbar buttons in the upper-right corner of the window -- they are larger, better looking, and easier to target.
- You can now lock the aspect ratio for desktop scaling so when you resize the RD Tabs windows and tab panes, your desktop doesn't get squished.
- New command line options have been added for connecting to a favorite by the XML-encoded full path or the FavID (below).  You can get the information from the favorites editor.
- All favorites have a GUID now, called the FavID, which can be used to reference a favorite even if it moves to another folder or its name changes.  Note that importing, duplicating, or overwriting an existing favorite using the "Add Favorite" button will cause the FavID to change.
- New feature: password reveal.  This is for those times when OOPS you lose the password to something important and it's trapped, encrypted, in RD Tabs.  Hold down CTRL and SHIFT and then double click on the "Password" label in any favorite or connection properties dialog.  RD Tabs will then require that you lock and then unlock your computer to allow you to view the password.  The reason for the locking part is to make sure that a full Windows authentication takes place before revealing the password as a way to protect the data in case the user walks away from the computer and forgets to lock the computer.  For those concerned about security implications of this feature, all strings associated with password dialogs are stored in Windows as plain text in memory and so this is no less secure.  It's just an added convenience.
- Password encryption is now much stronger for the favorites.  All passwords are now salted separately from each other, so even repeated passwords for multiple favorites will not reveal if the password is, in fact, the same.  Encryption and decryption is now slower, which in and of itself is not necessarily a bad thing, but if you notice RD Tabs favorites loading/saving taking too long now, let me know.
- If when you are doing a batch edit the changes will take longer than 100ms to complete, a progress bar will now appear.
- You can now set tabs to have a color.  This will help to easily spot a tab you want to keep your eye on when you have quite a few open.  You can batch edit this property like any other.
- The main RD Tabs window and the "Tab Window" secondary windows now have the currently active tab title in the title bar.  This was requested for scripting purposes.
- Fixed compatibility issue in Windows 8/8.1 where remote computer information could not be launched because UAC detection was throwing an exception.
- Improved handling of unexpected exceptions.  Previously there were cases where RD Tabs would not catch the error and you were presented with the standard Windows appcrash dialog.  This isn't good because then I never get the error report!  This usually happened during unmanaged exceptions or for worker threads.  It was pretty rare, but happened often enough to be a problem.
- Removed "Allow Password Savings" setting.  It was confusing to end users and provided negligable improved security.  If you need to block password saving, use the group policy.  Previously saved passwords are not removed until they are resaved.  This includes favorites history files.  This is not new behavior.  This setting was included back before RD Tabs had really good password encryption.  Also, neither the RD Tabs setting nor the registry setting can block people from saving passwords in text files, so the benefits are dubious at best.
- Moved NLA checkbox to logon page for better visability.
- The executing UI culture context for RD Tabs have been changed to "invariant."  This will cause .Net exception messages to appear in English, so that way when error reports are sent to me from other cultures and regions, I can read them.  :-)
- New feature: PowerShell integration!  You can run PowerShell scripts based on per-tab connection events or ad hoc.  RD Tabs exposes methods for UI automation.  More PowerShell integration will be added in the future.
- New connection property sheet for storing and showing notes in favorites.
- Status bar code was rewritten so it supports DPI scaling and is more graphically responsive.

2.1.25
------
- Fixed a bug where if you have Windows set to a DPI that is larger than 100% (larger than 96 DPI), RD Tabs would partially freeze and became unusable.  The workaround is not ideal, but it will be good enough, I think, until the next major version which will properly handle various forms of screen scaling.
- Improved Network Level Authentication (NLA) feature.  You can now use saved credentials from within RD Tabs with NLA.  Previously you had to use the standard Windows security provider, which required entering username and password manually on each connection.  If you leave the username, password, and domain all blank, RD Tabs will operate in "Single Sign On" (SSO) mode, where it will use the credentials of the user it was launched as.  Note that SSO requires special configuration of your domain to work.  It is not enabled out of the box.  http://blogs.msdn.com/b/rds/archive/2007/04/19/how-to-enable-single-sign-on-for-my-terminal-server-connections.aspx
- Fixed a bug where the Disable Remote Desktop Protocol Compression checkbox was reversed.  Previously, if it was not checked, compression was disabled.  Oops.
- Fixed a bug where in Windows 7 when you disable full screen, the menu bar would disappear.

2.1.24
------
- CSV File Import instructions were missing from the help file.  I added that. :-)
- Fixed a bug where sometimes restoring a minimized full screen RD Tabs window would cause the menu bar to reappear if it had already previously been hidden.
- Fixed a bug where sometimes when you resized the RD Tab window and had the remote desktop set to "scale oversized desktop to fit in tab pane," sometimes scrollbars would appear anyway, even though they shouldn't.
- Reduced flicker during tab switching on some systems.

2.1.23

- Fixed a bug introduced by the roll-out of the Windows 7 RDP client by Microsoft.  The new client control changed the format of a particular set of strings RD Tabs uses to determine what drives to redirect if you are selectively redirecting the drives.  RD Tabs now accounts for both types of string formats and it is smart enough to know which version of the client you are using.  I love it when APIs randomly change without notice.  Awesome.

2.1.22
------
- Fixed a bug where under certain conditions, the remote desktop will have a limited clickable area and you will not be able to click on things towards the bottom and right side of the remote desktop (such as the start button and task bar).  Reproducing this error is a bit complicated, so for details please visit this link http://www.avianwaves.com/Forums/Default.aspx?g=posts&t=59 in the forums.
- If user input hooking fails to initialize, RD Tabs will warn you about the condition, but will continue to load.  Previously, RD Tabs would exit as if it was a fatal error.  Some users may be okay with this error condition and it also gives them the opportunity to change the user input hook options through the GUI.
- Fixed a bug where characters outside of the ASCII range were not being saved in the passwords of favorites.  Password saving now supports the entire Unicode characterspace.
- Fixed a bug where if favorites in your RD Tabs config file were corrupted in a particular way, launching them would cause the launched tab in RD Tabs to freeze.  Thankfully, the entire application did not freeze.  RD Tabs now will correctly catch the bad configuration and let you know what is wrong.

2.1.21
------
- In Manage Favorites, some keyboard shortcuts were repeated (ALT+E).  Each keyboard shortcut is now unique.
- Fixed incorrect assembly versions in the previous release of RD Tabs.  This does not affect performance, but it does make debugging more difficult.
- Added more breadcrumbs to some methods that are generating exceptions in rare cases.
- Fixed a bug where if you sent a tab to a new tab pane, you wouldn't be able to set keyboard focus on the tab by clicking in the window with your mouse.  You instead had to click on the titlebar.

2.1.20
------
- Fixed a bug where if you had the IE-7 style "Create New Tab" preference enabled and then dragged the tab adjacent to the "plus" tab (the "new tab" tab) to another tab pane or tab panel, the RD Tabs UI could become unresponsive until the tab is dragged back to its original location.
- Increased an initialization time-out for the Tab Manager so that RD Tabs doesn't crash on startup when a system is under an extraordinarily high resource load.
- If you cancel a pop-up dialog, redial will now also cancel.
- Maybe fixed the very rare "Arithmetic Overflow" and some of the rare "OutofMemory" errors related to some graphics stuff. If not, I also added more breadcrumbs to try to find more out about those really obscure errors.
- Fixed a bug where if you tried to launch RD Tabs at nearly the exact instant that RD Tabs finishes clean up after exiting, you might get a crash that says something about not being able to access a disposed object.

2.1.19
------
- Fixed more numerous RDP file import bugs (below).  There must not be too many people using this feature since these bugs seem to persist for a long periods of time before being reported. :-)  Individual bugs are listed below...
- Fixed a bug where RDP file import would throw a non-descript error if drive redirection was disabled in RDP files generated by RDC 6.0 and newer.
- Fixed a bug where RDP file import would ignore half of the settings saved in the RDP file.
- Fixed a bug where RDP file import would not overwrite display name under some conditions.
- Added new parsable RDP file parameters: screen mode id (full screen = fit to app window, custom = custom), compression, desktopwidth, and desktopheight.

2.1.18
------
- Changed redial behavior slightly.  Previously, it would only redial if the connection returned an error.  Now, redial happens anytime the connection terminates while connecting.  Once a connection is established, it will no longer redial.  The reason for the change is primarily because Server 2008 tends to return error code 3 (user cancelled remote session) when it is not ready to receive remote connections because it is shutting down.  So if you connect with redial while a server is shutting down, wanting it to just wait until the server is ready for you automatically, you were out of luck!  The second reason is that it didn't really make sense to stop redialing on a non-error result like how it does for auto-reconnect on network issues.  The user most likely wants RD Tabs to just keep trying until the server answers, regardless of the error code.  Whereas with the network issues, you probably don't want it to reconnect after you intentionally disconnect.
- Changed the redial label as a result of the above.  It now says "Redial on connection failure."
- The disconnection code mentioned above has been changed to say "Session was disconnected remotely by user or computer" since Server 2008 now uses it to inform a remote desktop client that it is not ready to receive connections.  (In Server 2003 and older, you would only see this error if you disconnected intentionally.)
- Disconnection code 2825 was added.  This value is returned when the remote computer requires NLA but NLA is not enabled.  Brief instructions are also given on how to enable NLA in RD Tabs for a session.
- Fixed a bug where if you start RD Tabs from one command line and then issue commands from another command line after closing the first one, RD Tabs would no longer respond to commands from the command line.  Additionally, you would see an exception in the View Console Output window under Help.
- Added a more detailed exception handler in the LightWeight StatusBar.  There's some arithmetic overflow getting reported on a few computers out there.  I'm trying to figure out why.  I can't seem to find a common cause.
- Added an option to the error reporter that allows you to include your email address if you want feedback on the error or if I have additional questions about what you were doing that caused an error.  This is a completely OPTIONAL section!  Feel free to leave it out.
- Fixed a bug where if you set a custom screen resolution higher than Pre-RDP 6.0 maximum values, saved it as a favorite, and then tried to edit the favorite, RD Tabs would crash because the value would exceed the .Net bounds check for the NumericUpDown control.  RD Tabs now sets the maximum bounds to RDP 6.0 value when you are in the favorites editor.  However, if you are using a pre-RDP 6.0 control registration (which is not a default RD Tabs installation at this point), RD Tabs will use the highest value it can on connection, if the maximum value is beyond what the control is capable of displaying.

2.1.17
------
- Fixed a bug where in the options if you enabled or disabled password saving, and then cancelled out of the "are you sure" nag box, the favorites' ability to save passwords would go "out of sync" with what was in the options (you would lose passwords and if you tried to enter new passwords, they would just disappear).  The reason is that the favorites is an isolated object and maintains its own flags about what state the "saving passwords" operation is in.  In the future I will likely write code to allow the favorites manager to communicate with the main app's flags, but for now, I simply fixed the syncing problem by making sure both values are always updated simultaneously.
- Fixed a bug where in the options if you enabled or disabled password saving, and then cancelled, the "Apply" button would still light up, as if you made changes that need to be committed.  This has been fixed so as not to cause confusion.
- When password saving is disabled, RD Tabs will now write "Password saving is currently disabled" (or something similar) in the password textbox in the favorites / connection properties editor.
- Fixed a minor UI bug, where in the favorites manager, if you clicked "batch edit" without first clicking the already highlighted root folder, it wouldn't do anything.  By default, RD Tabs highlights the root folder, so the expected result is if you hit "batch edit" it would batch edit the root node.  RD Tabs now sets focus to the treeview immediately after opening the favorites manager to fix this odd UI behavior.
- Fixed a bug where in the Favorites Manager if you renamed a folder with subfolders, sometimes RD Tabs would freeze and sometimes favorites (or folders) would disappear or be moved to an incorrect location.  There are no reports of this failure happening when moving folders, but it might happen there as well since the buggy code is related to both functions.
- Fixed a bug where when automatically reconnecting to a server after a network dropout, sometimes RD Tabs would say "attempt X of 0" when the maximum reconnection attempts was set to 0 (infinite), instead of simply saying "attempt X."
- Eliminated most of the "flicker" that you see when you create a new tab.  Basically, the tab now sizes itself correctly in the background before becoming attached to the visible part of the application.
- Fixed the context menus in the Favorites Manager to include newer features that were accidentally left off in the initial release (such as "duplicate" and "rename").  (Note: these features always worked using the buttons on the right side of the windows -- this is just a context menu fix.)
- Added some code to make sure that the Tab Manager is fully instantiated before referencing it for the first time.  Additionally, if the control never instantiates after a pre-defined time-out value from the start of the thread block, it will throw a different exception.  This way I can determine why on a few very obscure clients, the Tab Manager is not finished being instantiated by the time I use it, despite it being initialized automatically by the framework in a (supposedly) thread-safe way.
- Fixed a rare bug where if you click on "create new tab in active pane" while a tab is closing in the millisecond that there is no active page (before a new one is set), you could crash RD Tabs.  I couldn't recreate it in testing, but apparently some people just have bad luck!  Anyway, if you happen to do this, instead of RD Tabs crashing, it will simply create a new tab in what is referred to internally as the "First Tab Pane" which is always the uppermost leftmost tab pane.  From there, you can drag the tab to whatever tab pane you were actually attempting to create it in.  Additionally, I prevent the individual tabs from requesting focus if they are closed (just in case that's the cause, but I don't see any sign of it)
- The export favorites to RDTSF dialog that has you enter the encryption password does not ask for a confirmation password (to make sure you didn't typo).  This has been changed.  You must now enter the password twice (like every other program in the universe).

2.1.16
------
- Fixed a bug where if you cancelled changes while batch editing, the changes would be applied anyway (as if you clicked on OK).
- Added breadcrumbs to the "create new tab" method to catch any strange exceptions happening there.

2.1.15
------
- Fixed a bug where sometimes RD Tabs would crash on loading due to a null reference exception (bug introduced in 2.1.14 due to the AutoHotKey fix).
- Updated the Error Reporter so that it includes the Service Pack version of the operating system.

2.1.14
------
- Fixed an issue where if you are using the amazing AutoHotkey app, some scripts will cause RD Tabs to stop responding to the scroll wheel for scrolling through tabs in the tab title bar (I'm not entirely sure of the cause, but think I have implemented an effective workaround).
- Fixed some messed up index ordering in the options dialog (for when you use the tab key to navigate).
- Fixed a bug where inline autocomplete would never enable in the favorites/default connection editor, no matter how it was set in the configuration.

2.1.13
------
- Fixed a bug where some XP machines couldn't open the import or export settings dialog in some cases.
- Fixed (hopefully) a null reference exception that was happening on startup fairly rarely.

2.1.12
------
- Added a missing a link in the help file.
- The default for the "middle click close" setting has been changed to "enabled" instead of "disabled" since most other TDI applications have this set to enabled by default.  This only affects NEW RD Tabs installations.  Existing ones will keep the existing settings.
- Fixed a bug where in certain display modes (such as Vista's Aero Basic or Windows Classic), you could actually sometimes see the imploding window animation of the minimize operation performed when switching tabs.  "Minimize" is, indeed, sent to the terminal control to prevent it from using network bandwidth while not on display, but you should not see the animation as it is happening.  I have fixed it so it removes the control from the collection before sending the minimize signal.  So it has the same network bandwidth reducing effect without wasting time showing the minimize animation.
- Laid some groundwork for 2.2.  No functionality changes, just some supporting code for the next version.
- Fixed a bug where the display name "Sync" button was enabled in the properties editors even when the display name field was NOT enabled.
- Made the redialing/reconnecting dialog bigger since attempts over 10 of 1000 would cause the "1000" to line-wrap and you wouldn't see it!
- Fixed a bug where the reconnection feature would mistakenly use the redial retry interval and max retries after the first reconnection attempt.
- The arbitrary limit of redial/reconnection maximum attempts has been raised to 1,000,000,000 intead of just 1000.  So, like, 1,000,000,000 should be enough retries for ANYBODY, right?
- Specifying a value of 0 for redial/reconnection maximum attempts will now cause RD Tabs to retry indefinitely.
- Fixed a bug in the settings import/export dialog where non-Vista operating systems would sometimes encounter a "missing method" exception.
- Fixed a bug where you would rarely get a null reference exception when you attempted to open the Connection menu.

2.1.11
------
- Most of the bugs fixed in this release are a DIRECT result of error reports submitted by users.  Please, keep them coming!  Adding a description of what you were doing when the error occured helps tremendously as well.
- Fixed an obscure null reference exception on start-up when there is a corruption of the auto-start favorites configuration.
- Modified the RDP 6.1 detection code somewhat.  Some systems (seems to be mostly XP SP3 systems) indicate RDP 6.1 support, but when 6.1 methods are invoked, they return TYPE_E_ELEMENTNOTFOUND, which means it can't find the 6.1 method I'm trying to invoke!  This is probably due to a corrupt Windows installation.  The new code attempts to invoke the method in a try..catch clause and if it fails, it falls back to RDP 6.0 mode.  If you absolutely need 6.1 features (such as terminal services gateway), you will need to attempt to manually reregister the RDP 6.1 mstscax.dll in the system32 folder and reboot. (regsvr32 mstscax.dll)  If this fails, the service pack may need to be reinstalled.
- Added a GUID field for the error report.  The GUID is randomly generated anytime RD Tabs is run for the first time (or the user.config is deleted) for each user.  This lets me track how wide-spread a problem is.  Before I had no way of knowing if one person was sending me 10 of the same error report or if 10 people were affected.  The GUID is 100% random and is in NO WAY tied to your IP address or anything remotely identifiable from a privacy perspective.  You can see your GUID in the error report toward the bottom should RD Tabs crash.  If it's all zeros, it failed to generate a GUID (for whatever reason), but this is not a fatal error, just an inconvenience for me. :-)
- Changed a few compiler flags on some of the DLLs that may or may not improve performance on 64-bit systems.  (But why not, right?)
- Added the ability to enable or disable "public mode" which controls the username/domain caching feature of RDP (mentioned in RD Tabs 2.1.10).  This option is in the General tab of the Options, toward the bottom: "Cache connection properties."  This single setting (unfortunately) also enables/disables the ability to ignore certificate warnings on servers with untrusted root authorities that you decide to trust on a case by case basis. (Updated documentation with this feature.)
- Fixed a bug where if device enumeration detection fails, it will not crash RD Tabs but will instead simply notify the user that device enumeration is not working.  This will affect the ability of setting granular permissions on device redirection and usually indicates a corrupt RDP (and Windows) installation.

2.1.10
------
- This release is considered stable.  The compiler debug flags are turned off and optimizations are turned back on.  Welcome to RD Tabs 2.1 RTW!
- Fixed a few typos.
- Fixed a menu where there was an extra separator line.
- Modified some of the error reporting behavior.  When you are prompted if you want to run the RD Tabs Self Repair utility and you select "no," it will now allow you to submit a bug report through the error reporting module.
- Another benign disconnection code was being reported by RD Tabs as an error (Session was disconnected by remote server).  I fixed this!  I think this was a bug introduced by something I fixed in 2.1.9.
- For Windows Vista (and newer) users, RD Tabs was allowing the RDP control to cache login information if entered through the RD Tab UI (this is a feature that is automatically enabled unless RD Tabs explicitly disables it).  Since RD Tabs has its own favorites system, logon caching has been disabled for security purposes.  Note that only the username and domain were cached, not the password.  So although information disclosure was possible, the real threat was very, very small.  Never-the-less, I disabled it for maximum security!  Remote desktops will no longer "remember" your username if you don't want them to. :-)
- Made the password decryption code more efficient and hopefully fixed a very obscure error where sometimes RD Tabs won't be able to decrypt saved passwords due to a decryption exception, so it will delete and generate a new decryption key.
- Fixed a bug where if you specified that RD Tabs should automatically open a single favorite when the application starts, it wouldn't work most of the time.  Opening an entire folder of favorites would work.
- Fixed a bug with the SysKey feature where sometimes the captured SysKey would get "stuck" when you used the SysKey sequence to open a menu, then used it again before closing the menu by hitting the Escape key or mouse click.
- Remove "Floating" from the Tab Panel titlebar (it's just redundant).
- Fixed a bug where the tab title bar in tab panels would sometimes be covered by the menu bar.
- Fixed a few graphical inconsistencies in some icons.

2.1.9 (Release Candidate)
-------------------------
- Added a few more disconnection error codes with regard to Network Level Authentication.
- Fixed a bug where you could still click on the status bar "cancel" button even during times that the remote desktop client control will not accept cancellation, such as during pop-up dialog boxes (can cause odd RD Tabs behavior).
- Added a new catch for another COM exception generated when the RDP control is not registered correctly.  This will allow you to automatically launch the self-repair utility if RD Tabs fails as a result.
- Added a new feature to the options where you can disable the input hooking feature that RD Tabs uses for various parts of the application.  Certain computers (certain models of laptops mostly) don't respond well to low-level input hooks and RD Tabs may have lags/freezes/slow-response when certain basic window functions are clicked (such as minimize, restore, maximize, or close).  Look under the "General" tab in the options for this feature.  Typically, if you are experiencing a lagging response to the afforementioned control box functions, disabling the mouse hook is sufficient.  The keyboard hook appears to not cause any problems.  RD Tabs will let you know which features are affected when you disable any low-level input hooking.  Special thanks to the Avian Waves Forums members who reported, worked on, wrote code, and tested this issue with me (I was unable to replicate it on my test machines so the help was GREATLY appreciated).
- RD Tabs user Sebastiaan Brozius was able to convert the low-level mouse hook to an application mouse hook to fix the afforementioned "lag" problem on some computers due to the mouse hook.  I'm still leaving the ability to disable input hooking in RD Tabs in case a future problem arises.  Many thanks to Sebastiaan!  Note: The keyboard hook cannot be converted to an application hook because a low-level hook is required to pre-empt the message pump BEFORE the remote desktop focus in order for the SysKey feature to work correctly.  Since the mouse hook features (tab title bar mouse wheel scrolling) do not require a low-level hook, an application hook works just fine!
- Fixed a bug in the Connection Thumbnail Selector where it wasn't showing thumbnails of tabs that were hidden.  This is directly related to the optimization made in 2.1.7 for hidden tabs to use less network bandwidth.  I forgot to bring them back to a visible state before taking a screen shot.
- When you disconnect in a non-error state, the remote desktop will now provide you with the disconnection details (such as "session closed by remote server" or "sessions disconnected/cancelled by user" etc).
- Disconnection code "3" (disconnected by remote computer) was being called an "error" by RD Tabs, but it is not actually an error as it is a valid forceful disconnection usually by somebody at the console bumping off somebody logged on through remote desktop.
- The bugs are all pretty minor now, so I'm dubbing this Release Candidate.  If there are no big errors in the next week, I will turn off debug mode, recompile, and RD Tabs 2.1 will finally be RTW!  (Assuming I can finish the 2.1 documentation...)

2.1.8 (Beta)
------------
- If TLS is required and you clicked "OK" after the certificate warning, RD Tabs would erroneously say that the user did not want to proceed, when in fact the "TLS Required" flag is what prevented RD Tabs from proceeding.  This error message has been corrected.
- Fixed a bug where if you were using "fit to tab pane" for your remote desktop screen dimensions and you closed some tabs, then opened the same connections or new ones from favorites, the connection window would only be about 250x200, instead of filling up the tab pane.  This bug did not effect the "fit to app window" or "custom size" modes.
- Fixed a pretty serious cryptographic flaw in the RDTSF file format.  This fix is going to be applied to version 2.0.14 as well.  Versions in the 2.0.x line older than 2.0.14 and versions in the 2.1.x line older than 2.1.8 will create vulnerable RDTSF files.  I apologize for not noticing this sooner.  I'm withholding details of the exploit to protect users of older RD Tabs versions and give them time to delete all old RDTSF files!  For more info, go to this link: http://www.avianwaves.com/Forums/Default.aspx?g=posts&m=372&

2.1.7 (Beta)
------------
- Began working on a generic interface for all protocol controls, so I can eventually wire in non-RDP protocols into RD Tabs.  There should be no functionality change, as I literally just created an interface and wired up "implements" on the RDP control.
- Fixed a long outstanding issue where screen data from a remote RDP session will still use the network even if the tab is not in view (RDP is capable of suspending screen updates while not in view to conserve network traffic).  RD Tabs performance should increase as a result of this fix.  Since I had to tamper with some pretty core areas of RD Tabs, let me know if you ever switch to a tab and the remote connection just disappears or something of that nature.  (Seems to be okay to me so far, but you never know!)
- New feature: You can now choose between using the "add new tab button" on the left side of each tab pane, as was introduced in RD Tabs 2.1, or use the IE7 (and RD Tabs 1.x-style) "new tab tab" where the right most tab in each tab pane creates a new tab.  This is entirely a matter of preference.  They are both functionally the same when clicked by the left or right mouse button.  Keyboard shortcuts also have not changed.
- Fixed a bug where when you selected certain pages (such as the Warning page) in the options, the apply button would erroneously light up, even if no settings have changed.  This one is actually different and more intermittent than the similar bug fixed in 2.1.6.
- In order to ease the burden on my poor update server, RD Tabs will now only check the update server a maximum of once every 12 hours, no matter what the interval is set to in the config file.  Addtionally, if it has already checked the update server within the last 12 hours, it will not perform an automatic check on startup.  This does not affect the manual "check for updates."  So as not to negatively affect the user experience, RD Tabs will remember a previous successful automatic check, and will give you the download link again within a minute of starting RD Tabs (useful if you close the application before downloading the new RD Tabs).
- If the RDP control initializes, but throws a COM expection while setting default properties (a very peculiar rare error where an error of type TYPE_E_ELEMENTNOTFOUND is generated on any call to the initialized control), RD Tabs will now allow you to choose to launch the RD Tabs Repair Utility to try to see if re-registering your RDP COM library might help fix the problem.  You can always select "no" and send an error report, if you encounter this error but the repair tool does nothing to help.  According to MSDN, this error is usually genrated when something in a computer's COM subsystem is corrupted.
- Cleaned up part of the RD Tabs main form initialization.  There was a part that was doing redundant work, so I combined it into one step.  It is probably unnoticable performance-wise, but I cleaned it up never-the-less!
- In some cases, device redirection would cause RD Tabs to crash.  I don't know the cause yet, but I think I have figured out the trigger.  It seems that in the cases where it crashes, the remote desktop library is returning a NULL collection.  Since RD Tabs is expecting a collection object, even if it's empty, it will throw a null reference exception.  I now detect for a NULL collection and if RD Tabs gets one, it will tell the user it could not enumerate system devices.  I also put "you may not have permission" because I'm assuming (possibly errantly) that this is a permissions problem.  So at least RD Tabs will not crash, even if device redirection is not working.
- Fixed a bug for XP users.  When importing settings in 2.1.6 or newer, you would receive an error saying something about a missing method called "AutoUpgradeEnabled."  This method is only supported on Vista, so for XP users, the exception is ignored if it is thrown.
- Modified behavior: if a warning is thrown during settings import, it will remind you when the import finishes.
- Fixed a bug where under Windows Vista, if your system was under high load (CPU or disk or memory) and you started RD Tabs, rarely a strange exception would be thrown about a null reference exception.  For some reason (I suspect possibly even a framework bug), in this high load case, the "OnActivated" event was being fired BEFORE the completion of the constructor and the "OnLoad" event.  I have since put a check into the OnActivated event handler to make sure the objects it is accessing are not null before attempting to use them.

2.1.6 (Beta)
------------
- RD Tabs 2.1 is now feature complete, and, as such, testing has entered the "beta" phase.
- Fixed a bug where the remote desktop on detached tabs would not respond to fast mouse movement or mouse clicks appropriately sometimes.  This was due to unnecessary focus messages being sent to the main window after the window was already focused.  This bug did not affect the main RD Tabs window nor did it affect floating tab panes.  It only affected isolated floating tabs.
- Added some more diagnostic information to the error reporter: Compiled CPU type (x86 or x64) and file versions for the loaded MSTSCLIB library (file versions may differ even when assembly versions are the same, so I need this additional information to debug certain error reports coming in showing the crash happening in MSTSCLib).
- Fixed some typos.
- Fixed a bug where if the system HTTP URI handler is not associated correctly, clicking on links in the "about" box would cause RD Tabs to crash.  Now it just tells you it cannot open the site.
- Fixed a bug where in the options when you clicked on the "SysKey Shortcuts" tab, it would erroneously enable the "apply" button even if no settings have changed.  It now correctly only enables the "apply" button when settings have changed.
- Fixed a bug where in some cases if you cancelled a warning prompt (such as a certificate warning) with automatic redial enabled, the redial would kick in and attempt to reconnect, even though you cancelled.  This was due to not catching certain error codes correctly and not realizing they were not, in fact, errors.
- Modified the behavior of the "automatically open console window when new input..." feature.  Before it was quickly opening and closing this window even if the RD Tabs application was not already running (meaning that you were invoking a command from the command line, but you did not necessarily want RD Tabs to stay open).  Now it will only open the window if the application stays open.
- New feature: Import and export settings from both the Options menu AND the command line.
- New feature: A new button next to "Display Name" in the connection properties allows you to "sync" to the computer name.  Basically what this does is clear out the Display Name entry and replace it with the current Computer Name so that both titles are the same.  This is useful if you have a long Display Name and you quickly want to replace it with the actual Computer Name (usually after disconnecting from a favorite).
- New feature: In addition to being able to have RD Tabs only open favorites in a new tab if the active tab is currently connected, now you set it to use the active tab as long as the active tab has never connected to a remote server.  If it has connected and then has been disconnected, a new tab will be used.  The layout of the behavior in the options is a little cleaner, using radio buttons for each state, instead of cascading checkboxes (which, to me, was a little confusing).
- Added breadcrumbs to the keyboard input handler on the thumbnail selector to try to trap a rare exception I'm seeing in error reports.
- Fixed a bug where if you imported an invalid favorites file, it would proceed to attempt to import the data anyway (which would be empty).  RD Tabs now correctly goes back to the file selection dialog to choose a valid file.
- New feature: You can now change the display name while you are connected. There is a menu item in the status bar menu that lets you do this.  It will bring up a non-modal dialog (so you can switch to other tabs) that will hover over the connection until you dismiss it or enter a new name.  I tried to make it a color that stands out from the remote connection.  Is orange okay?
- Fixed a bug where the display name parser was incorrectly parsing %-escape codes.  Basically, I was parsing each code separately on the total string from the previous step, so if a tab's display name had a % in it, it would parse it if it was an escape code for the remaining steps.  Instead of parsing each code separately, I now parse the string from start to finish linearly, replacing each escape code with the correct string as I go. This is the correct way to do it, I was being lazy before and just using String.Replace(). ;-)

2.1.5 (Alpha)
-------------
- RD Tabs now will let you launch Microsoft's Terminal Services Manager from the "Tools" menu for features not available in Remote Computer Information.  If you are running Vista with UAC enabled, you will automatically be prompted to elevate to an administrator account.  XP and non-UAC computers may have limited functionality unless RD Tabs is running under an administrator account as well (which is not recommended).  The work-around, of course, is to "Run As" the command manually for elevation, which is tsadmin.exe, located under System32.  Note that if tsadmin.exe is not found, RD Tabs will not show this tool under under the "Tools" menu.
- New feature: You can now choose to scale a higher resolution desktop down to the size of the current tab pane, instead having to rely on scrollbars.  This is a feature in the Remote Desktop API that I completely missed (it's been there for quite some time), but it was very easy to implement and very handy, so it's a part of 2.1's feature list now!  In case you are confused, this basically lets you keep the same resolution remote desktop while resizing RD Tabs to any size you want.  So your remote desktop connection may be 1024x768, but if RD Tabs is only 400x200, the remote desktop will be shrunk down to fit.
- Fixed some typos
- Fixed the icon for "New Detached (Floating) Tab panel" in some windows that didn't have the correct icon.
- Fixed a bug in Remote Computer Information where when UAC was enabled it would sometimes incorrectly report an "invalid credentials" error, even after an elevated Remote Computer Information launches successfully.
- Fixed a bug where the MRU for remote computers did not work in the favorites editor (the MRU list was empty).
- New feature: There is new a setting in the Options dialog that lets you control how RD Tabs will open favorites.  Previously you could only select as a default "Open in new tab" or "Open in active tab," but now there is a third option.  If you select "Open favorite in a new tab (as opposed to the active tab) in the active tab pane" you can set an exception to that rule by clicking the checkbox below it that reads "Unless the active tab is not connected, in which case use the active tab."  Basically, if that is checked, RD Tabs will only open favorites in a new tab if the active tab is ALREADY connected to a remote computer.  So now you won't have the extra blank connection you have to close manually, if you use this feature.
- Created some more new "breadcrumbs" to track errors that happen during the initialization of the RDP control.
- Added some "automatic repair" features way ahead of schedule, to help with problems stemming from upgrading to Vista SP1 and the RDP control not registering properly.  RD Tabs will now prompt you if you would like it to automatically fix it, and if you select yes, you will be prompted for admin credentials and then it will do it's thing.  So far, I've actually had a little luck in dragging RD Tabs binaries from one PC to another and running it without actually running the standard installer.  RD Tabs may become portable (like, for thumb drives) ahead of schedule, but NO PROMISES! :-)  The new rdsr.exe is the application that actually performs the repair operations.  It's designed so that I can add new "fixup" scenarios to it for support requests without having to distribute an entire new RDTabs.exe and related DLLs.

2.1.4 (Alpha)
-------------
- The remote sessions in Remote Computer Information was (and is) experiencing issues in Vista SP1 with UAC enabled.  Apparently the API doesn't like to be called "too often" so I had to insert a mandatory delay to allow whatever clean-up it's doing before enumerating the remote sessions.  Secondly, in regard to UAC specifically, RD Tabs will no longer query remote servers UNLESS you are already elevated.  This prevents another problem where even after elevation, it will still give you an "access is denied" error until you quit and restart RD Tabs.  I have no idea why this is happening.  I can't trace what call is returning access is denied.  It SHOULD NOT, but it is sometimes.  This problem is intermittent.  The new workarounds work reasonably well enough that I'm calling this fixed unless I hear otherwise.  You can disable the timing workaround by modifing rdrci.exe.config (under Program Files) and setting EnableSessionScanCleanupDelay to False.  DO THIS AT YOUR OWN RISK.
- Because of the above intermittent problem, Remote Computer Information is now it's own EXE (rdrci.exe) and can be invoked from the command line.  It will require elevation when run this way if UAC is enabled under Vista.  The argument format is as follows: rdrci.exe <Computer> <RDP port>.
- Fixed "Connect to console" bug.  The 6.1 API no longer supports "Connect to console" but has a replacement mode called "admin session."  On Server 2003 and lower, it works exactly the same as "console session" but on Server 2008, there are changes to the behavior.  See the following for details: http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb892064.aspx .  Until this version, RD Tabs did not recognize the new API call.  Now it will automatically call the correct API setting, depending on what version of RDP is on your system.
- The "Connect to console" checkbox text has been changed to "Use console / admin session" to reflect changes in RDP 6.1 and Server 2008 (above).

2.1.3 (Alpha)
-------------
- RDP 6.1 Good news: RD Tabs now supports it!  This version now supports Terminal Services Gateway!  
- RDP 6.1 Bad news: It will only work in post Vista SP1, post XP SP3, and Server 2008 deployments... Also, it seems to be slower now when you connect to your first session.  This also happens in the mstsc.exe (Microsoft's version), so it's not unique to RD Tabs.  I guess it just has more overhead than before.  I ran ProcMon during the one second additional wait and it hits thousands and thousands of registry entries (speculating that may be the cause of the delay).  Sigh.  It's not too terribly noticable, just annoying.  And there's nothing I can do about it.
- RDP 6.1 Details: The 6.0 control is included with RD Tabs for legacy deployments, but 6.1 (due to many changes in the underlying control and deep library dependencies) requires the latest service packs (Vista SP1, XP SP3, Server 2008) to work.  The libraries are included in Microsoft updates.  RD Tabs will no longer contain the latest RD control because of these backward compatibility issues, but will instead rely on Microsoft and Windows Update.  XP SP2 and older systems will have the RDP 6.0 libraries automatically installed.  Vista and later will not, but will instead use the Windows built-in versions.
- Really fixed the drawing bug in the status bar this time.  I guess I should check my bug fixes before saying they are fixed in the change log.  :-)
- The afforementioned Resource Manager now has a more benign non-error message when it is not on display (it's a canned message, what can I say?) so that if you peak at it using a tool that can "see" hidden windows (such as the thumbnail task switcher powertoy for XP), it doesn't freak you out with an error message that isn't actually happening.
- The "About" dialog now includes a little more diagnostic information (mainly only useful for me): number of open tabs and number of tabs that are cached for later reuse.
- "Disable Remote Desktop Protocol compression" was moved to the "Experience" tab to make more room in the "advanced" tab for new Terminal Services Gateway options.
- Terminal Server Gateway options are now available, but may be buggy because I do not have a TS Gateway to test with.  Please test this for me!
- If an extended reason (descriptive text) is provided by the remote desktop control for previously unidentified disconnection codes, you will now be able to see that text, even if RD Tabs is not aware of what the problem is or why it occurred.
- Not all TS Gateway disconnection/error codes are programmed (I couldn't find a list and cannot currently test scenarios).  Please report the disconnection code number and any descriptive error text provided, if you discover a new one.
- Fixed a bug in one of the lightweight label controls where text wouldn't wrap properly in some cases.
- Updated the batch editor to support Terminal Services Gateway settings.
- The policy checker module will disable saving of gateway passwords if Remote Desktop is set to not allow saving of passwords.
- The RD Tabs "allow password saving" option must be enabled to allow saving of gateway passwords.
- Fixed some typos.
- Added a maximize button to the batch editor interface.
- Streamlined the look of the batch editor for under Vista (some of the controls drew off-center and looked funny).
- The Remote Computer Information's ping tool was reporting inaccurate response times on some systems (notably very innaccurate on Vista systems).  This has been fixed.  Additional error messages may appear as well, such as "unreachable" or "TTL Expired" when applicable.
- You can now change the ping timeout in the Remote Computer Information tool on the fly now by clicking on the "Set Timeout" link (good for high latency networks).  I'll probably move this to the application Options eventually, but this is just to get this feature in place for immediate use.  Default (and minimum) is 500ms.  Not sure why, but any value under that is ignored by the framework's ping command.  Also, no matter what you set the timeout to, no more than one ping per two second interval will be sent out, in order to avoid ping-flooding remote servers. This bug occurred as a result of the new, more responsive, disconnection code.

2.1.2 (Alpha)
-------------
- Fixed a bug where if certain fonts were not installed on your system, if fonts were corrupted, or if you customized Windows to use non-standard fonts that don't support certain rendering styles (such as bold, underline, italics, etc.), RD Tabs would crash instead of simply using a suitable substitute font.  There may be some I missed in this class of error.  Please report them if you find them.
- New feature: If you have so many tabs that they scroll off the edge of the screen and you scroll your mouse wheel in the top area where they are located, it will scroll the tabs left and right.  It's a nice easy shortcut so you don't have to use the scroll buttons.
- New feature: Added the ability to duplicate favorites from a single folder to another folder (or the same folder).  Recursive duplication and folder duplication is not yet available, but will be added eventually.  This feature was bribed out of me by a donation.  I have a price. ;-)
- Fixed a drawing bug in the new status bar.  Sometimes when you would open a menu or something, it would flicker and shrink really quick for just a moment then expand back to normal.  Really more of an annoyance as the statusbar still worked correctly.
- The disconnect timeout has been changed from 30 seconds to 120 seconds (two minutes) to deal with high resource usage situations where RD Tabs might crash due to the underlying remote desktop connection not responding within a reasonable amount of time.
- Rewrote the way the disconnection process works, as far as the "wait" portion (I have to wait for the control to clean up before I can tell it do anything else).  Instead of using the main thread and a while-loop, I'm now using a timer which frees up the main thread for other work.  Works much better!  You should notice peppier performance with disconnects, especially over high-latency networks.
- Fixed a bug where if you closed a whole bunch of tabs at once (such as by closing a floating tab panel or closing all tabs in a tan pane), the remote computer name would not clear in the tab cache, so when you opened up a blank tab, you would see the server name you previously were connected to.
- Fixed some typos.
- Made an icon for the Floating Tab Panel in the Connection menu.
- Fixed a bug where if you run the rdtabs.exe too fast in succession (for instance, by script), occassionally an exception would be thrown due to certain operations happening out of order (asynchronous execution is annoying).  RD Tabs handles this more gracefully now and will attempt to not execute methods on forms that are not yet created!
- Fixed a bug where if you open the main menu at the exact right moment while all tabs are closing, but before they have reopened, you could cause RD Tabs to crash.  The reason is that before showing the menu, RD Tabs checks the active tab's current state (so it knows whether to show the reconnect/disconnect items and so on), but if there is no active tab (which happens only for a short instant), it would not anticipate this and would crash with a null reference exception.
- If settings from a previous version were corrupt or inaccessible, RD Tabs would crash.  Now, RD Tabs presents you with an error message indicating that it cannot upgrade old settings and asks you if you want to proceed anyway (without the upgraded settings).
- Added more diagnostic information to the error reporting module.  It will now send me CPU time, virtual/actual memory usage, handle count, thread count, process duration, and more useful debugging items.
- New feature: You can now import Comma Separated Values (CSV) files into favorites.  There is a specific 9-column format that RD Tabs requires, but that should be easy for any CSV exportable application to produce (such as Excel or SQL Server).  You can leave a column blank if you don't want to specify the data (except for the computer name), but the column MUST exist.  Not all favorites properties can be imported, but I tried to include what I thought were the most important ones for the introduction of this feature.  The columns are (in this order): Display Name, Computer Name/IP, Port, Username, Password (clear text), Domain, Connect To Console (value 1 or 0), Security (Legacy RDP = 0, Require TLS = 1, Attempt TLS = 2), Enable Network Level Authentication (value 1 or 0).  Use 1 for "true" and 0 for "false."  All empty and unsupported settings will use the values in the Default Connection Properties.

2.1.1 (Alpha)
-------------
- Fixed a bug where importing RDP files did not work at all (This bug fix matches the bug fix in 2.0.13 stable since 2.1.1 Alpha was released before 2.0.13)

2.1.0 (Alpha)
-------------
- Improved custom "tab list" (and all future "lightweight") control redraw performance by queueing immediately successive redraw events so that they happen in one call every 10ms (instead of immediately).  This has reduced redraw CPU usage by about 70% without sacrifising user experience.
- The 64-bit specific release of RD Tabs is now well tested and will parallel the release schedule for the 32-bit version (instead of being stuck in perpetual beta like during 2.0.x).
- RD Tabs 64 will now say "RD Tabs 64" in the title bar so you can be sure you are not running the 32-bit RD Tabs in Windows-On-Windows (WOW).
- The "About" dialog also contains build information (x86 or x64) for debugging purposes.
- RD Tabs Update now differentiates between the 32-bit and 64-bit platforms, providing the download link for whatever platform invoked it.
- Set a breadcrumb for device redirection since enumerating existing devices was causing some error reports to be generated.  The next time this happens, I'll have a better picture of what is crashing.
- Fixed a resource leak in the way favorites were being cleaned up when the menus were repopulated.  It's really more of a drip or trickle than a leak and the .Net Framework probably disposes of it during garbage collection anyway, but I'm trying to run a tight ship here, so it's fixed!  :-)
- Big new feature: Floating Tab Panels!  Works just like the main window, only you can now have unlimited alternate RD Tabs windows open and split them into as many tab panes as you want!  Very useful for multiple monitor configurations.
- Smaller footprint: The RD Tabs' statusbar has been completely re-written from the ground up.  Before it was the usual .Net statusstrip, but now it is custom written and very light "windowless" control.  It uses only a single window handle for all pieces within it and offers superior responsiveness and lower memory usage than the Microsoft solution (which, to be fair, does a lot more than the custom one, but RD Tabs doesn't need those features).
- Smaller footprint: I was able to consolidate several timer controls in the RDPControl into one control.  Less controls equals less resource footprint and that makes everybody happy!
- Fixed a bug where in the Batch Favorites Editor, if you clicked back and forth between the field checkboxes and the connection property textboxes, the focus would jump out of the text box to the tab control in the connection properties.  You'd have to click twice on the textbox for it to receive focus.
- Fixed a bug where if you typed in a new computer name in the Batch Favorites Editor, the display name field, although disabled, would copy what was in the computer field.  This is mainly just a visual bug that could be confusing.  Functionally, display names (which are used to uniquely identify favorites) were not changed!
- New option: You can now enable a setting in Options (under Tabs) that will automatically close a tab when the remote desktop disconnects.  Keep in mind that "automatic reconnect" will override this setting when there are network problems that cause a disconnection.
- Fixed a bug where the "capture Region of Remote Desktop" feature would allow you to select an area outside of the remote desktop's desktop.  This would give you the undesirable result of nothingness being capture into the clipboard.  Thankfully, rather than crashing, the nothingness took on the color of dark blue.  Anyway, now it limits the capturable area to the remote desktop's desktop.
- New feature: The "Remote Computer Information" dialog now executes on a separate thread, has its own taskbar entry, can be minimized, and is otherwise non-modal with respect to the rest of RD Tabs.  So now you can monitor server upness, log remote users off, etc., all while clicking around in tabs in the main app (or any new tab panel).
- Fixed a bug where if you were connecting to a tab in one pane, and were working in another, when the connecting tab actually connected, keyboard focus would get lost.  This was a very complicated one that required a lot of rewiring for the ways I was handling remote desktop keyboard focus.  The good news is my new method is way cleaner and seems to work great with multiple tab panels with multiple tab panes with multiple tabs.  The bad news is that since it's a lot of rewiring, it could be buggy.
- Fixed a bug where if you were typing in a tab's connection properties computer combobox and another tab connected, the combobox of the connection properties of the tab you were typing in would clear.  This was due to the MRU list of the combobox being updated in the middle of your typing.  The MRU list now only updates when you first enter the combobox, so although it may not be up-to-date until you click out of it and back into it, it will no longer clear out while you were typing (which was very annoying).

2.0.14
------
- This version was released at the same time as 2.1.8 Beta.
- Fixed a pretty serious cryptographic flaw in the RDTSF file format.  This fix is going to be applied to version 2.1.8 as well.  Versions in the 2.0.x line older than 2.0.14 and versions in the 2.1.x line older than 2.1.8 will create vulnerable RDTSF files.  I apologize for not noticing this sooner.  I'm withholding details of the exploit to protect users of older RD Tabs versions and give them time to delete all old RDTSF files!  For more info, go to this link: http://www.avianwaves.com/Forums/Default.aspx?g=posts&m=372&

2.0.13
------
- Fixed a bug where importing RDP files did not work at all

2.0.12
------
- One of the resource watchdogs that RD Tabs spawns was causing confusion for Vista users.  This is because in XP, this thread is "hidden" and not visible by normal means.  In Vista, however, it pops right up in your Task Manager task list with its bold scary title, "Error: Low on Desktop Heap."  The thing is, this watchdog has a scary title, but it's only of concern if you actually run low on Desktop Heap.  But when you see it in the task manager, even if it's not active, it looks as if you ARE low on desktop heap, even when you are not.  So I renamed the title of the watchdog thread to "RD Tabs Resource Monitor" so it's less confusing.  It will now only say "error" if there is an actual error to be concerned about.  Sorry about the confusion!

2.0.11
------
- Error reports submitted since version 2.0.9 regarding the obscure "crashing on load" problem have given me ideas on what is happening.  It looks like some object is just not getting initialized in time before it is being called, which honestly should be handled by the framework, but I'll have to work around it anyway.  I moved the offending code further down the line so that more time has passed before it's accessed.  By doing so, I took it out of the "load" event and put it into a "post-load" method called via a timer after "OnLoad" completes.  Hopefully, with all this new code, this problem will disappear.  There are even more breadcrumbs added in this version, in case it doesn't disappear!
- Due to design changes in the 2.x codeline, RD Tabs was not catching if your mstscax.dll got unregistered (for whatever reason).  So you would get the standard error reporter.  These scenarios are not bugs (but not catching them is a bug) so I don't need the error reports.  I changed the code to catch this exception again and it will now tell you what's wrong and how to fix it.  In a future version I'm going to try to make this process more automatic.  (Like in Vista, I'll try to make it prompt to elevate and then fix the problem for you.)
- New feature:  You can now screen capture a region of a remote desktop, instead of just the entire remote desktop (great feature if you do lots of documentation with screen caps, like me).  This feature is available in the status bar pulldown, the Connection Menu pulldown, and a new context menu when you right-click on the screen capture shortcut icon in the status bar.  The screen is "frozen" the moment you activate the region capture, and then you will be given the opportunity to click and drag a rectangle over the area you want saved into the clipboard.
- If you invoke RD Tabs Command Line arguments from a different shell (prompt) than the program was originally run from (or if it was originally run from a start menu link) you will see no text output at the console when executing commands.  This is because it will have no knowledge of what console to "bind" to.  Sorry, this is a limitation I can't overcome right now, so...
- To address the issue in the line above, there is a new option under "Help" which says "View Console Window Output" which will open a prompt that will contain an output history for every command you have issued.  Additionally, under options, you can specify that this window will automatically open whenever new commands are issued to RD Tabs from the command line (disabled by default).
- Updated the help file to reflect the new features (new sections and screenshots).

2.0.10
------
- The error reporting module has been updated.  First, if the destination host (the report receiving server) was unreachable, the reporter would itself crash sometimes -- this has been fixed.  Second, I've added a dialog where you can enter in a description of what you were doing when the error occurred.  This will help me put errors in context.  It will be of great help if you include this additional information!  Thanks!
- You can rename favorite folders from within the Favorites Manager now.  Sorry about neglecting to add such an obvious feature until now! :-)
- The Favorites Manager can now be resized to any size and also maximized -- another obvious feature missing until now!
- Added a maximize button to the "Move Favorites" and "Add Favorite To..." dialogs.
- Modified the appearance of a couple of "OK" and "Cancel" buttons which previously were exceedingly large or out of the "normal" order.
- The new "splash screen" window now has the RD Tabs icon and title so when you "Alt-Tab" while RD Tabs is loading you don't see some random application in the process list that you don't know what it belongs to.
- Added a new little feature: You can set RD Tabs now to close a tab if it is "middle-clicked" (as in, middle mouse button).  Go to Options->Tabs, then select "Close tabs by clicking the middle mouse button on the tab title."  This feature was requested by a few people.  Enjoy!
- Updated the help file to reflect the new features (new sections and screenshots).
- Fixed a few "bugs" in the help file where a couple topics were not correctly associated with index keywords.

2.0.9
-----
- Based on error reports I'm receiving, there's some obscure circumstance where RD Tabs will crash while loading due to some undefined object (the report is unclear).  I added breadcrumbs to the loading process to help guide me to a solution when this happens again!  I apologize for the inconvenience.
- Fixed a bug where after using screen capture functions (such as the remote desktop screen capture or the connection thumbnail viewer) you will see rogue entries in your "alt+tab" task list (ONLY this task list).  The entries will say "BitBltStagingForm."  RD Tabs using a special "invisible" form to screen capture an unobstructed view of remote desktops.  I wasn't closing the forms after opening them!  OOPS!  Sorry about that.  I also changed the name of the form and gave it the RD Tabs icon so that if it appears again it's VERY OBVIOUS which application is doing it! :-)
- Fixed the very rare, but very annoying, null reference exception that occurs sometimes when the framework attempts to hide the splash screen (even if you have the splash screen disabled).  If it still happens after this, by all means, SEND THE ERROR REPORTS!  
- Fixed a few typograchical errors in some text strings.
- Fixed a bug where the "screen capture" item in the status bar's pulldown menu did not actually do anything.  I forgot to implement it.  Oops!  :-)
- Change in behavior: On some buttons, you previously could right-click on them and they would activate just like they were left-clicked.  This does not conform to standard Windows usability guidelines, so now only the left-button response works.  In the future, the right mouse button may provide some context menu handling on some of the buttons, which is allowed.  The affected buttons include the full screen mode buttons, and the shortcut buttons for "save to favorites," "disconnect," and so on in the status bar of each tab.

2.0.8
-----
- RTW release!
- Fixed a bug where the "Hide Full Screen" menu item was not disabling when you leave full screen mode.  If you clicked on it when not in full screen mode, nothing happened anyway, so this is a very minor bug.
- Fixed a bug where if you used the keyboard to activate a favorite (say by hitting "enter") nothing would happen.
- Fixed a bug where even if SysKeys were disabled, the "Key Up" event for the specified or default SysKey modifier key was sometimes trapped (would cause the particular modifier key to get "stuck").
- Added the ability to bring up a favorite's context menu by clicking the special "context menu" key (also known as the "app key") near the windows logo key to the right of the space bar on some keyboards.
- Added more keyboard-friendly handling to the favorite's context menus (easier navigation without the cursor getting lost)
- Embedded an application manifest for each EXE in the RD Tabs application folder.  This manifest is very basic, but was included to provide the execution level information that Windows Vista likes to have.  Apparently, from what I read, in OS's after Vista (and, I'm assuming, after Server 2008), application manifests will be required, so might as well include it now!  Just FYI, RD Tabs runs "as invoked" for all EXEs except the uninstaller helper application that requires administrative priveleges to clean up COM registrations so that other remote desktop applications don't break after uninstalling RD Tabs (unlike some unnamed commercial competitors of RD Tabs which don't play so nice).
- Fixed a bug where after opening and then closing (or docking) a floating tab, some SysKeys would not respond (such as SysKey+\ and SysKey+Insert)
- Fixed a bug where SysKey+T would sometimes always activate the top-left active tab (whether or not the tab pane was active), instead of the active tab in the active tab pane.
- Fixed a bug where if you split the screen into nested tab panels and then you closed a panel, sometimes the orientation would switch (horizontal to vertical split or vice versa) on active tab panes after the closed tab pane cleaned up.  The problem was that as tabs and tab panes were pushed up the tab panel tree when certain levels of nesting were not needed (tree clean-up), the orientation of sub-panels was not always correctly copied to the parent panels.
- Renamed "Local Resources" tab to just "Resources" because remote sound is not actually a local resource!  That was a typo on my part from a long time ago when I was redesigning the connection properties dialog.
- Changed the "Experience" checkbox which said "Desktop composition" to "Desktop composition (ie, Aero Glass)" so that users know what "Desktop composition" actually means -- Aero Glass via remote desktop!
- Fixed a bug where the tab pane splitter bar would be one pixel off from center sometimes due to a rounding error.  I'm nit-picky!
- Fixed a bug where if you edit multiple favorites and saving passwords is disabled, you would still be allowed to enter password data into the text box.  It wouldn't save long term, but it would let you enter the data.  This is simply a usability bug.
- Fixed a bug where if you hit cancel when initially selecting a filename for export, it would leave the filename blank (undefined/null) which could cause an exception.
- Fixed typo/error in SysKey+F2 Help: The SysKey+] and SysKey+[ functions were transposed.
- Updated SysKey help dialog.
- Widened the profile cleaner's default window width a bit.
- Added a few more error catchers for Remote Computer Information.  You probably won't ever notice they are there, but they trap thread exceptions and show errors if necessary.

2.0.7 (Public Beta / Release Candidate)
---------------------------------------
- Second release candidate... Let's try this again!  Hopefully the bug count will again slow down!
- Fixed an issue where the reconnection counter wouldn't reset to zero if a connection automatically reconnected to a remote session more than once before deliberately disconnecting and reconnecting (or closing the tab).
- If you click the download icon from the automatic update feature and close RD Tabs, the update will no longer terminate when the application closes.  This is not true for the manual "RD Tabs Update" feature since that is an embedded browser object.
- The automatic update will now show a pop-up balloon in the tasktray if you have the tasktray icon enabled.
- Fixed a bug where if you entered full screen mode and the gray bars appeared to fill the empty space between the desktop and the tab pane, if you exited full screen mode, sometimes the gray bars would stay, even though the desktop exactly fits the tab pane.
- Fixed a bug where sometimes the active tab would lose keyboard (but not mouse) focus if you entered / exited full screen mode, captured the screen, or hid / unhid the menu bar using a Sys Key.
- Fixed a bug where when using arrow keys in the Tab Thumbnail Selector, the focus would not follow the selected thumbnail.
- The Tab Thumbnail Selector now has its own tab in the options.  You can also enable two new features.  One is where the active tab is automatically scrolled down to and highlighted when entering the thumbnail view (Automatically select the active tab after entering Tab Thumbnail Selector view).  The other highlights the selected thumbnail (the one with the current keyboard focus) even if you are not using the keyboard -- in other words, the red box around the thumbnail is always visible (Always highlight the thumbnail with keyboard focus (even if you are not using the keyboard)).
- Added a few missing icons in the menus.
- Fixed a bug where if you disconnected and then reconnected (using the reconnect button, which ignores any new settings you put in the connection properties), the remote desktop resolution would not always be in sync with the size of your application window if you had the display screen size set to "Fit to application window."  (basically it would be set at whatever resolution you first connected to with)
- Fixed a bug where if you disconnected and then reconnected (using the reconnect button again) and then saved the connection as a favorite, it would take the properties of whatever has changed in the connection properties dialog INSTEAD of using the actual settings which were in use (the previous successful connection a la the reconnect button).
- I have changed the behavior of a connecting tab.  Previously in 2.0 (like in older versions of RD Tabs), after successfully connecting, input focus would automatically switch to the tab.  Now you can choose if you want it to or not.  Under the "Connection" tab in RD Tabs Options, look for the checkbox "After successfully connecting, tab will automatically steal input focus and set itself as active tab"
- Fixed a bug where if you attempted to enter the "Tabs" menu by using a keyboard shortcut and if it had never been opened by mouse clicking before, it would be empty and inaccessible by keyboard.
- Fixed some display issues with the SysKey Notification.
- Started to update the documentation help file.  Consider this version a rough draft.
- Updated the "save passwords" warning message to remind users of the Profile Clean-up Utility.
- Fixed a bug where if you clicked to close a tab, cancelled the close in the warning message, then attempted to close the tab again at any point in the future, the close button wouldn't respond and there actually would be no way to close the tab short of exiting the application entirely.
- Added a few missing keyboard shortcuts (of the "&" variety) in the menus.
- Changed the "Floating Tab" icon for the taskbar so you can distinguish it easier from the main RD Tabs application.

2.0.6 (Public Beta / Release Candidate)
---------------------------------------
- Fixed a bug where there was about two pixels of "invalid" drop space between each tab when you were dragging and dropping tabs.  Now the transition is seemless.
- Fixed a bug where RD Tabs allowed you to "drop" a tab onto the "add new tab" button or tab title scrolling buttons and then the tab would be dropped into a confusing position for the user.  Basically now it just puts the invalid drop icon on the screen instead.  You can still hover over the title bar scrolling buttons to scroll while you are dragging.
- Fixed a bug where when the tab title bar was scrolling towards the end (scrolling right) it would sometimes not complete the scroll and would end up being just one pixel shy of a location where you could drag and drop a tab so that it would be located at the end of the all the open tabs in the pane.
- Added a new utility: the RD Tabs Profile Clean-up Utility.  You can access it from the Tools menu, or by executing "rdprofclean.exe" from the RD Tabs application folder.  This tool allows you to view all user.config files for all versions of RD Tabs for your user account on the computer you are currently logged onto.  You can now easily dispose of pre-2.0 profiles which may contain unencrypted passwords, etc.  I still HIGHLY recommend using EFS ontop of RD Tabs' built-in password encryption, for maximum security!
- Changed the default "first system key stroke" back to the Right Control key again.  The reason is that although Right (Green) Alt is great for Americans like me, in other keyboard layouts AltGr is used as often as shift is for us yanks!  :-)  Sorry about that to all my international users.  Didn't mean to catch you off-gaurd.  All new users will not experience the interruption.  Current users need to MANUALLY set the keystroke to something other than right alt (AltGr) in the options under System Key Shortcuts.
- Additionally, to avoid further confusion, System Key Shortcuts are DISABLED by default.  It is more of a "power user" feature (I LOVE IT) and I don't want people turned off by RD Tabs because it's acting unresponsive.  Again, current testers will have to disable it manually.  This is just a default setting change.
- Added new buttons (link labels) in the "Select Drives" and "Select Devices" redirection options.  You can now "Select All" or "Select None" which will hopefully make it a little easier to select the target drives/devices you want.
- If the microsoft remote desktop DLL disappears from RD Tabs' folder (which can happen apparently if you uninstall, reinstall, uninstall, reinstall many times in a row without rebooting after it recommends rebooting) RD Tabs will now catch this and tell you that a simple repair operation on the installation will fix the problem, instead of generating an error report.
- Added a few more items to the Task Tray icon to make it more useful, along with the corresponding icons associated with those actions.
- When in full screen mode with the menu bar hidden, RD Tabs now requires that you "hover" the mouse at the top of the screen for about a half a second before it will show you the menu.  This is closer to the behavior of most other applications when menu bars are hidden.  Before RD Tabs would just require the mouse to enter the top line of the screen.
- The "Options" dialog in the Tools menu has been re-organized slightly to try to make more sense and make it easier to find what you are looking for by using more group boxes.
- There is a new option that allows you to revert back to RD Tabs 1.x "hide menu bar" behavior where you have to click the top line of the screen to get the menu to return.  This option disables the "hover" ability that temporarily causes the menu to return when the mouse hovers at the top of the screen.  This option is called "Do not show menu when mouse hovers at top of screen (click to unhide)."

2.0.5 (Public Beta)
-------------------
- Fixed a bug in RD Tabs' message pump hooks which were causing certain remote desktop user interface "lags."  This was most noticable when you would try to "click and drag" a window by its title bar in a remote session.  Sometimes you had to hover the mouse cursor over the titlebar for a second or two before the click would register.  This was due to a bug which was causing a remote session which was already in focus to still receive "set focus" events repeatedly each time a mouse click event occurred.  Essentially what was happening was the remote desktop couldn't respond to the mouse event quickly because of the the lag introduced by RD Tabs interrupting and repeatedly setting focus.  This has been fixed.  Just FYI, this error only affects 2.0 because of the advanced nature with which 2.0 examines the Windows message pump for a more consistent user interface.  (On their own, the remote sessions have very poor notification systems for mouse/keyboard events).
- Fixed a bug where detaching and reattaching (floating and unfloating) a tab with an active session could crash RD Tabs due to issues tracking clean-up events during the transition from docked to floating or vice versa.
- The .Net Framework clipboard methods have issues copying data onto the clipboard when the clipboard is "busy."  These are known issues and the only current resolution is to wait and try again.  RD Tabs would crash if the clipboard was busy due to it not catching a particular exception when the screen capture button was pressed and data could not be copied.  This has been fixed.  It will inform you that the clipboard is busy and you need to wait a few moments before trying again.
- The order of the pages in the Thumbnail View was not sorted in any way previously.  This has been changed to be sorted in the same order as the Tabs menu, which is alphabetical by Display Name.  (Tie breakers are deteremined by the tab's connection timestamp.)
- I am trying to make it easier to determine which tab is the active (in focus) tab when you have multiple tab panes open by highlighting the very top of the tab with a tint of yellow/orange (similar to how tab panels look in XP).  Let me know if you like this.  The former all white versus white-to-grey gradients was a little hard to see on some lower quality monitors.  Also, if you use a custom color scheme with alternate system colors, the system colors will be different in RD Tabs.  The orange highlight, however, will stay the same.  I may make this customizable in the future.
- Some "Sys Key" shortcuts cannot be successively pressed without letting go of the designated key (alt, ctrl, whatever) and pressing it again.  This is due to what the Sys Key does and how it would affect the UI if successive pressed were allowed.  I had to add SysKey+T to this list because when the remote desktop receives keyboard focus, the buffer has to get flushed to basically sync up the current shift/ctrl/alt status with the remote session.  Before it was causing some weird results if you held down the keys and switched back in, not the least of which was that the sys key notification wouldn't light up properly.
- Just tapping the "Sys Key" causes the active tab to lose focus if you are connected to a remote session.  This was done by design but was not pointed out in previous releases.  This is good if you are having the remote session trap your Windows Key Combinations and you want to access your local computer's Windows Keys.  Remember that Sys Key + T (or clicking into the remote session's window with the mouse or "tabbing" into the remote session) sends focus back to the remote session.
- Attempted to fix a minor bug where in Vista RD Tabs would "ding" when you hit enter to connect to a remote server from the username or password field.  (I can't test this on my development machine since it's XP, so that's why I say "attempted")
- It's come to my attention that RD Tabs will not currently work under Windows x64 (XP or Vista).  I will address this very soon after the 2.0 release by releasing a separate x64 compiled version.  Since I have to compile separate versions, I'm going to enable x86 compiler optimizations for the 32-bit version (and x64 compiler optimizations for the 64-bit version).  Let me know if this causes any new problems.
- Caught some new exceptions when file browser dialog would not correctly filter out opening invalid paths (such as folders).  It now tells you that the path is invalid instead of crashing.
- Converted last few remaining "old dialog" message boxes over to the modern Windows message boxes.  This conversion conforms to Microsoft's UI standards of what is a "warning" (yellow exclamation icon) and what is an "error" (red "X" icon).

2.0.4 (Public Beta)
--------------------
- Fixed system key notification ("Sys Key" green block) bug where it wouldn't always appear (hidden behind other objects)
- Fixed system key notification bug.  The notification block was not anchored to the right side of the window and sometimes showed up in the middle of the menu bar.
- Moved the full screen Minimize button to the left-most button in the three button cluster to the right of the "Open a new tab" combobox.  This was done to make the user interface more consistent with other Windows applications.
- Fixed an issue where if you changed the task bar button from enabled or disabled while in Full Screen Mode, the window borders would creep onto adjacent monitors.
- Fixed a bug where if you minimized RD Tabs with the taskbar entry disabled, it would minimize by becoming a tiny window floating just above the task bar.  It now hides completely.  Note that you may see it "blink" above the task bar before disappearing.  This is normal.  RD Tabs is catching it trying to minimize there and is "hiding" the window when that happens.
- Fixed a bug where if you did not specify the domain for alternate credentials in Remote Computer Info, RD Tabs would crash.  Now it will look for this and pass a blank string to GINA in the domain's absence so depending on your version of Windows' behavior, it will either assume the local remote computer or the current windows domain as the authenticating domain.  If you specify more than one backslash, it simply will not authenticate (that is an invalid character for a username or domain), so you will get the generic "bad username/password" error.
- Some minor accessibility features were tweaked through out the application to work a little more logically and smooth when using only the keyboard.
- Had to remove the Windows Logo keys from optional System Keys since when you select the option to send all windows-key combinations to the remote desktop, it will pre-empt even unmanaged keyboard hooks!  I can't figure a way around this one... So for now you only get the option of left/right Control or left/right (green) Alt.
- Added a new feature where when you hit System Key + T, it will bring the active tab back into focus.  This way if you are keyboarding around in the menu and want to get back to the active tab, you won't have to use the mouse or hit ESC and TAB a bunch of times trying to find the active tab's focus index.
- Fixed a few tab order (focus) issues with the RDP control.
- Due to some really strange behavior, RD Tabs will now trap the System Key sequences completely and not pass the keystrokes onto underlying controls.  This will prevent using the system key for its normal purposes if it is enabled.  Sorry, but I was running into situations where "double" key presses (handled by the system key system and the normal control with input focus) were just getting out of hand and causing strange unpredictable behavior.  This really isn't any different than Virtual Server trapping the right-alt key.  System keys can be disabled if you don't like this.  And you can select the right or left side of the keyboard and either Control or Alt for your preference!  Sorry!
- System key notification now first lights up when only the system key is pressed (to remind you) with faded out text which then then turns black when an actual sys key sequence is pressed, otherwise it just disappears.  Remember when you allocate your system key is now off-limits for normal operations.  In a future release I'll probably make this more flexible where you can do it this way, or simple assign a key you never use (for instance, Scroll) and it will bring up a context menu with all the Sys Key options.  I want to provide the maximum amount of possibilities for users!
- Finished Favorites menu context menu features.  You can now right-click on Favorites or Folders and get options to open them or their children in the current pane or new panes.  Enjoy!  Please note that the open folder feature only opens the IMMEDIATE children not all nested children.  This is by design!
- Changed the tab and tab pane context menus so that there are less clicks to create new tabs or tab panes ("Send To" -> "New Tab" -> <Direction> has been reduced to having four "Send To" -> <Direction> menu items, for instance).
- Fixed a few bugs where when using a Sys Key shortcut for certain options, the dialog/screen/whatever would open and then immediately close.
- Fixed a bug where if the server name was invalid in the "Open in New Tab" combobox, a blank tab with no "Remote Desktop Connection Properties" would open, making the tab basically useless.  It now correctly tells you the error and allows you to modify the options and connect again.
- Fixed several bugs (seem to be left over from 1.x.x codebase) where illegal characters (such as spaces or slashes) were not always being blocked from the remote server name or domain name.
- The right (green) "ALT" key has been changed to the default System Key as opposed to the right "CTRL" key.  Seems to make more sense to me since ALT is generally used less and CTRL is involved in a ton of shortcuts in most apps (don't want to interfere with that in the remote session).
- Tweaked the appearance of a few icons.
- Dragging a tab now uses a custom icon again like in version 1.x.x, so you can clearly see you are dragging and dropping a tab and not another object.
- Deleted a few unnecessary small files from the installation package left over from the 1.x.x codeline.
- Fixed bug where long error messages where not line-wrapping in the Connection Properties message box.  This bug was introduced by version 2.0.2 where the new less resource hogging "lightweight" controls were not measuring text width to see if the text should line wrap.
- Fixed minor bug where the automatic redialer and reconnector would retry N+1 times instead of N times, where N is the number of times you want it to retry.  Looked funny seeing "Attempt 11 of 10."  :-)
- Sped up the amount of time it takes to get into and out of Full Screen Mode by running most of Windows' transition effects offscreen (with the form in a "hidden" state so Windows doesn't spend time drawing the effects).  Of course if you had no windows animation effects enabled, it always was a quick transition for you! :-)  This doesn't affect Maximize or Minimize, so if you like your effects, you still have them there.  It only affects "Full Screen Mode" where I have to do window state and window dimension acrobatics to get it to display correctly.
- Fixed a few more bugs when minimizing/restoring in Full Screen Mode with the taskbar entry disabled.  
- Fixed bug where if both the tray icon and task bar entry are disabled, there was no way to restore RD Tabs if it was minimized.  Now you can simply run RD Tabs again from the Start Menu shortcut (or any shortcut, actually).  RD Tabs is a single instance application so it will open the already running instance instead of starting a new instance.
- Fixed a bug where if you hit the "reconnect" button but had changed values in the Connection Properties dialog, although the connection would be established to the previous successful connection (as designed), the "connecting" notifications and tab title bars would show the new values instead of the old values.
- Fixed a bug where if you launched RD Tabs a second time (through script or accidently double clicking from a quicklaunch icon) RD Tabs would crash because it would attempt to look for and process and execute command line arguments before the first application launch initialization completed.
- New behavior: If you run help from the command line (RDTabs.exe -?) the main forms part of the app will not launch.
- Fixed a bunch of other miscellaneous command line processing bugs, including the order with which windows are sized so that the remote desktop isn't using a small screen before the application goes into full screen mode and bugs that would crash RD Tabs under certain conditions.
- If you try to script the opening of tabs using the RD Tabs command line options and a batch or CMD file, the tabs may not open in the order you run the commands.  This is because although you are kicking off the subsequent RD Tabs processes (which communicate to the parent process to open a new tab) in the correct order, they are being launched only nanoseconds apart from each other so for all intents and purposes, they are being launched at approximately the same time.  Unfortunately, the Windows Process Scheduler may not then actually run the processes round-robin in a way that ensures the first executed process is the first to finish.  I have created a work-around for this problem.  All you need to do to ensure that the tabs are opened in the correct order is to insert a small pause inbetween each subsequent execution of RD Tabs.  This ensures that each process has time to initialize, send the appropriate message (such as open a new tab and connect to this server) to the parent process, and stop before the next instance of RD Tabs is launched.  To help you scripters out, I have included a small EXE in the RD Tabs application folder called "SLEEP.EXE" which will suspend the command line for however many miliseconds you specify (up to the maximum value of a signed 32-bit integer).  An example of usage would be: "SLEEP.EXE 500" to sleep for half a second.  Happy scripting!

2.0.3 (Private Beta)
--------------------
- Fixed a bug where sometimes the automatic update icon/button would not become visible after an automatic update check.

2.0.2 (Private Beta)
--------------------
- Slightly reduced each tab's resource "footprint."  This will be an ongoing process to reduce resource consumption.  All default Microsoft .Net's controls are "heavy" and full-featured.  But you don't necessarily need every line of text printed on the screen to respond to a gazillion different events.  :-)  I'm working on a "lightweight" control class to address this issue.  If you notice the "Connect To" dialog change ever-so-slightly it's because I screwed up in how I mimic the original heavier Microsoft version.  Report said display errors and I will attempt to fix them!
- Added some extra diagnostic code to the RDPControl so that when it errors out it gives the error reporter more information to send to me for troubleshooting.
- In certain cases, the default connection properties and favorites editor would not correctly show the actual saved values when opened (such as the authentication/encryption type).
- Fixed a minor display bug in the status bar of each tab (made a little white line appear on Vista machines)
- Fixed an issue where when you opened RD Tabs in Full Screen Mode and it defaulted to placing on the second monitor, the window borders would creep onto the first monitor.  This only happened when RD Tabs was first opened, not when entering full screen mode by clicking the button or menu item.
- The System Key notification (the "Sys Key" green block that lights up when you press a system key shortcut) has been moved to the right over by the shortcut buttons on the menu bar.  This is because in large font installations or even on Windows Vista standard installation, the notification area would trample over the Help menu.
- Fixed bug where RD Tabs would crash with a COM "HRESULT E_FAIL" exception if you tried to connect to a new favorite in a tab already connected to another remote server.
- Fixed a few display bugs (nit-picky incorrect pixel spacing).
- Tweaked the screen capture (camera) icon.
- Fixed a bug where RD Tabs would not always receive focus on application launch if RD Tabs went into Full Screen Mode by default (this is an old one from the 1.x days).
- Fixed a bug where if the underlying RDP control pops up a dialog box (for instance, a warning about TLS not being enabled) and you somehow opened a favorite by already having the favorites menu open before it appears and then you clicked on a favorite to load a new favorite over the connection which was displaying the dialog box, RD Tabs would crash because the underlying Microsoft RDP control becomes completely unresponsive if you send it connect/disconnect signals while a dialog it initiated is open (it's programmatically unrecoverable as the control itself dies and errors out on every operation thereafter - maybe a bug in MS code?).  The fix is basically a work-around.  If a dialog is opened by the underlying RDP control, RD Tabs will ignore all operations requiring a connect or disconnect request (such as loading a new favorite) until the dialog is cleared.
- Added a feature where if you right-click on a favorite, you will get a context menu asking in what way you want to open the favorite (new tab, same tab, new tab pane, or detached).  Unfortunately, due to limitations in the way the .Net menustrip system works, the menu disappears when you right-click.  When the "inline favorites" feature is created down the road, that will add more user friendly functionality!

2.0.1 (Private Beta)
--------------------
- After completing and testing everything below in 2.0.0, I've ticked the versinon count up and I'm letting friends and associates find the really bad bugs I missed!
- A few promised features are, indeed, missing.  But they seemed to be small enough that they can be debugged in the Public Beta.  One such feature is the context menu on favorites, so you can open an entire folder in a new tab pane, and things of that nature.  Look for that in 2.0.2.

2.0.0 (Alpha)
-------------
- First test release of the "2.0" version of RD Tabs.
- The "Draggable Tab Control" which has served RD Tabs well throughout its 1.0 life has been replaced by a new custom tab management control which is specifically designed and tailored for the needs of RD Tabs.  Connections can now be dragged, split into panels, detached (floated), and (of course!) tabbed.
- NO MORE BORDERS around the connection when Maximized or in Full Screen modes!  Plus, thinner border when open as a regular window.
- Due to the underlying structural changes of moving from the former tab control to the API, some features from 1.x have been removed or changed.  Tabs no longer support the capability of "stacking" on overflow.  The inline "close current tab" button has been moved from the tab's status bar to the tab bar.  The "new tab" tab has been replaced by a "new tab" button, present in each tab pane.
- Tabs can now be dragged into new panels (as many as you want) for parallel viewing of multiple remote desktops side-by-side.  You can add a new panel on any of the four sides of the current tab's panel.
- Tabs now have "Fit to tab pane" and "fit to application width" options for desktop size.  The difference is that one automatically fits to the current size of the pane the tab is located in, and the other fits to the ENTIRE size of the usable area in the tab manager, so that if other panes are closed, it will automatically use the full width and height available.
- Some initialization code in the remote desktop control wrapper has been optimized for faster creation of new tabs.
- The "Tab Cache" has been optimized for better performance when closing and recreating new tabs.
- Tabs now have pretty icons... and each icon is stateful!  You can see if a tab is connected, disconnected, or connecting.
- The menu layout has changed to look a little more like typical windows applications.  A "Tools" menu has been added and the "Preferences" menu has been removed.  For application settings, use the "Options" menu item in "Tools."
- More settings are available in the "Options" form than were available in the "Preferences" menu.
- RD Tabs has a new feature which I think might be very useful for troubleshooting.  You can now scan for common connection problems from within RD Tabs.  The new feature is called "Remote Computer Information" and it will resolve the DNS name and IP address, ping the remote server (ICMP Echo), check to see if the RDP port is open (custom port numbers are supported), and (if you have permission), it will list all terminal sessions on the remote computer.  You can even send messages to or terminate existing sessions (if you have permission).  An "impersonation" dialog is provided for quick account elevation if you need it.
- The non-modal "Connect To" dialog has been renamed "Remote Desktop Connection Properties."  This makes more sense to me.
- The non-modal reddish "error box" that would appear on a bad connection has been replaced by a non-modal status pane in the Remote Desktop Connection Properties (formerlly the "Connect To" box).  This is more efficient, to me, as you do not have to cancel away the error to return to the connection properties.
- The default "reconnecting" code has been replaced by a more efficient version specifically tailored for RD Tabs functionality.
- Auto-redialing has been added.  Remember the BBS days when the remote modem was busy and you'd just redial until it wasn't?  Same deal with this.  If the server isn't responding, it will redial until it does!  (You can specify how many times it will retry and how long it should wait inbetween redial attempts.)
- Saved passwords are no longer stored in clear text.  Saved passwords from previous versions will be automatically converted the first time you run RD Tabs.  Please note that previous versions of the configuration file (with clear-text passwords) will persist until they are explicitly deleted, so if you have previously saved passwords and want to protect them better, delete the old RD Tabs configuration files (user.config) and then run the cipher.exe utility.  Note that this new encryption does not offer 100% protection against unauthorized access!  This is how it works.  It uses Windows' Protected Storage subsystem to encrypt the passwords.  This prevents other users from fetching your passwords, but it is still possible for those with administrator access OR malware running under YOUR OWN USER ACCOUNT to get to your passwords (although this is not trivial).  It's still much better than before and it is AT LEAST as strong as password storage in Outlook, IE, or even Windows' native Remote Desktop Client.  Since the encryption key is stored in protected storage, the passwords section of the user.config is no longer portable from computer to computer.  Use the favorites "export" feature for portability.  Undecryptable password ciphers will automatically be converted to an empty string.  RD Tabs offers no way (on purpose) of revealing the password, but third party applications that tinker with other applications' memory run under an account with authority to "debug" may be able to reveal the password under the asterisks while RD Tabs is running.
- A "Tabs" menu has been added which shows all open connections and allows you to immediately select a connection to immediately jump to it.  The current active connection is bolded.
- A thumbnail view (similar to IE7's "quick tabs") has been added which allows you to quickly see your connections visually in case you can't remember which one is which by display name alone.
- You can now customize tab titles by modifying display name properties in the options.
- RD Tabs now fully supports most of the new whiz-bang features of the Remote Desktop Protocol 6.0.  The major exceptions are remote applications and Terminal Server Proxies.  Not sure how supporting remote applications would benefit RD Tabs users.  I'll keep an eye on the suggestions forum to see if anybody has differing thoughts.  Proxies are not currently supported because the capability is actually not even present in the public remote desktop library by Microsoft that RD Tabs (and most other third party remote desktop applications) use to function.  See the next comment for details on the gateway...
- Although the Microsoft Remote Desktop Client appears to support Terminal Server Gateways, the ActiveX control which RD Tabs uses to initiate Remote Desktop connections returns a "Not Implemented" exception whenever TS Gateway parameters are set.  My guess is that since this is a Windows Server 2008 feature and Server 2008 Server is not out yet, Not Implemented is Microsoft's way of saying "we may change this before release, so we aren't allowing you to muck with it."  At least, I hope.  TS Gateways sound really cool.  I'll keep you updated on when (if) this feature is implemented.
- The ability to specify an alternate shell instead of Explorer.exe has been added. (Analogous to "start this program after logon" options in other remote desktop clients.)
- The RDP file import supports most new RDP 6.0 configuration parameters.  Passwords still can not be imported from any RDP files.  (In 6.0, passwords are no longer stored in the RDP files for security purposes.  Passwords are instead stored in Protected Storage, which is similar to how RD Tabs now stores passwords in saved favorites.  However, neither application has access to the other application's passwords.  Sorry!)
- When importing RDP files, RD Tabs currently does not support named devices for "sharing" preferences.  You can either enable all devices or no devices.  This is because I have no idea what the RDP file looks like when named devices are exported. :-)  If somebody can shoot me an example file, I can fix this.
- You can now disable RDP compression (not sure why you would ever want to, though).
- A new menu, "Tabs," allows you to quickly view the title of and jump to any open connection.  The current active connection is bolded.
- Favorites are now exported using new file formats: RD Tabs Secure Exported Favorites (.RDTSF) and Unencrypted XML (.XML).  RDTSF files are strongly encrypted using a password that you supply.  Although the file can eventually be brute-force cracked (like all file-based password encryption), this adds a huge amount of security as long as you don't leave these files just lying around!  The unencrypted XML files are the successor to the old version 1.x RTFAVS file format.  I chose to just rename the extension "XML" now because it is a well-formed XML document and is, therefore, editable using various XML/text editors, should you so choose.  However, do this with extreme caution!  The new XML files are not backward compatible with RD Tabs 1.x.  There are just too many differences in the way the data is stored.  Yes, old RTFAVS files can still be imported into RD Tabs 2.0 for 1.x to 2.0 migration.  Because the password encryptor used in the user.config file is tied to your windows user profile, passwords can only be exported in clear text unless a new encryptor is used (such as a password), which is why the RDTSF file format was created.
- When importing favorites and selecting "ask each time" as the overwrite option, you may now select "cancel" as an option, which will cancel out of the import process and will roll back any changes that were made.
- The "full screen mode" buttons have been moved to the right side of the menu bar (to the right of the "Connect in new tab" combobox), which is the more natural location for those buttons in Windows.  They now push the combobox, toggle full screen, thumbnail, and update buttons to the left when in full screen mode.
- The Default Connection Properties dialog and Favorites editor is now using a new code which will allow a little more flexibility.
- "Batch editing" has been added in the Favorites Manager.  You can now modify one or more parameters on any number of selected favorites at one time.  For instance, if you need to update your password periodically, you can select all relevant favorites or favorite folders, check the box to update the password, type in the new password, and voila!  All passwords on all selected favorites will be updated at once.
- Buttons in the upper-right-hand corner of each connection in the status bar now allow you to save favorites, reconnect, and disconnect from sessions in one click.
- The Connection Menu has been modified so that there is no longer a sub-menu for the active connection.  This should reduce the number of clicks and mouse strokes needed to perform certain actions.
- RD Tabs now accepts a limited number of command line arguments for opening up new connections.  More will be added down the road (versions 2.1, 2.2, etc.) but for now, this should aid in scripting.  Keep in mind that RD Tabs is now a "Tabbed Document" application and only one instance can run at a time.  When you execute command line arugments after the application is open, it will affect the currently opened application (ie, open new connections in the current application instead of starting a new one).
- You can specify a single favorite or an entire favorite folder (immediate members only) to automatically open and optionally connect immediately when RD Tabs is started.  (Yes, the much requested web browser "default home page" feature is finally here!)
- Various "fixed size" dialogs now allow you to change the size of their window for easier viewing and working.
- Moving and deleting single items in the Favorites Manager now displays the title of the item in the title bar.
- Every version I release from here out I'm going to try to reduce the "control footprint" of the application to reduce the amount of window handles used by RD Tabs.  This will make it run faster, consume less resources, and make it less likely for your computer to run out of window handles when you are running 70 to 100 simultaneous connections (which, really, is quite an absurdly large amount, when you think about it).
- System Key Shorcuts introduced.

1.1.4
-----
- Fixed bug where favorites would not import if the display name and server name were not identical.  Yes, this is the same bug as in the "export" feature, only this time on the "import" side.  I should have tested it better before the 1.1.3 release!  Sorry about that.

1.1.3
-----
- Microsoft changed the implementation of the RDP Control's "Connected" property which RD Tabs used to determine the connection state of the active session.  Previously, the connection state would return "Disconnected" during an "auto-reconnection" sequence, but in RDP 6.0, it returns "Connected."  I had to recode the way auto-reconnections are handled and behavior is slightly different.  After an auto-reconnection, the titlebar of a tab will not show that the tab is connected until the entire logon sequence has completed (usually this is automatic and takes 5-10 seconds).  Otherwise, functionality is the same.
- In addition to the above change in behavior, I discovered a bug in the auto-reconnection sequence.  If you should cancel the auto-reconnection, it will sometimes still try to reconnect (without any user prompts) to the disconnected session once the network reappears to the computer.  I could not figure out a way to prevent this.  RD Tabs now detects if the "Connect To" dialog is open and if it is, it will attempt to forcefully disconnect the auto-reconnection of the cancelled session.  This is far from perfect.  If you have closed out the "Connect To" dialog, it will not detect this and connect anyway.  Sorry about this!
- Due to all these weird "auto-reconnect" problems, I will be bypassing the RDP control's internal auto-reconnector in RDP Tabs 2.0 and will implement my own.  This way I can control the bugs (of which, I'm sure there will be plenty)!  Until then, hopefully the above workaround will help some people.
- Fixed a bug where the clipboard would become "untied" sometimes from remote sessions which would require you to disconnect and reconnect to copy data back and forth to the remote session.
- Reworked the error reporting system to try to avoid warning the user about benign exceptions being thrown during the closing of the application.
- Streamlined some of the RDP ActiveX Control initialization code for faster response/instantiation and to make it more forward-compatible with future RDP ActiveX control releases.
- Fixed bug where favorites would not export if the display name and server name were not identical.

1.1.2
-----
- Added a link to the RD Tabs support forums.
- Fixed a bug in the automatic error reporting system where the locations exceptions occurred were not being reported correctly.
- Added more diagnostic information to the automatic error reporting system and RD Tabs assemblies to make it easier to figure out what is causing an unexpected error.
- Modified the uninstaller slightly to attempt to reregister the "Vista" RDP control instead of looking for the "Server 2003" RDP control first.
- Added more code to better detect if the correct RDP ActiveX control is registered.
- Added the internal "client level" of the ActiveX control used by the RDP control to the About box's RDP version string.
- Fixed bug introduced in 1.1.x code-line which broke the ability to configure whether tabs stack or scroll on overflow.

1.1.1
-----
- It has been tested and the 1.1.x code-line of RD Tabs is Vista-compatible.  Feel free to use this instead of the boring standard client on Vista!
- Fixed bug where the Default Connection Properties were not loaded into the "New Favorite" dialog when you tried to create a favorite from scratch from within the Favorites Manager.
- Fixed bug where if you exported favorites that have saved passwords, but selected not to export the passwords, the passwords would disappear from your favorites and would be lost forever.
- Added error code 1289 - This occurs when you cancel a connection after being prompted about whether to connect to a non-TLS session when the security property is set to "Ask"
- While working on XS BAP 2.0, I created a library that will automatically trap and send me uncaught exceptions (unexpected errors).  Since plugging it into RD Tabs is so easy, I went ahead and did that.  If RD Tabs crashes hard, please click the "Send Error Report" button!  It will help me greatly.  Thank you!
- Added links in the help menu... (1) The Avian Waves Music website (which is my first love); (2) The RD Tabs home page; (3) And finally, a shameless "begging for a donation" link!  :-)

1.1.0
-----
- RD Tabs now uses the RDP 6.0 control by Microsoft instead of the 5.2.x.x version.  This is why the RD Tabs version was incremented from 1.0.x to 1.1.x.  I'm going to be more diligent about incrementing minor version numbers when features are added and use the third decimal as a "patch level."
- In the "About" section under Help, you can now see which version of the Microsoft RDP Control is being used by RD Tabs.
- I want to get this update out ASAP, so I'm holding off on implementing many of the new Vista remote desktop features, but one I can add REALLY quick (and did) is the new maxmimum screen resolution, for those that hated getting stuck at a maximum resolution of 1600x1200.  The new RDP 6.0 supports screens up to 4096x2048, and now so does RD Tabs!
- Somehow the "on tab close" change that was supposed to be in the 1.0.8 release didn't find its way into the compiled application, contrary to what was stated in the changelog.  I'm not sure how that happened, but I think the code somehow didn't get "checked in" when I rebuilt the release (non-debug) version of the project.  It should work now as described below.
- Fixed typos!

1.0.8
-----
- Setup now creates a "RD Tabs" folder to store all things RD Tabs under the Avian Waves folder in the Start Menu, since I am writing more software...
- Attempted to fix issue where RD Tabs would occassionally (rarely) hang when closing.  It appears rarely that something is not cleaning up properly (or timely) in the RDP ActiveX control (or possibly the wrapper) and the application sits and waits... A ten second hard timeout is set up now which will hopefully cause a forceful termination if the application takes longer than ten seconds to close.  I won't know unless I see this issue pop up again.
- Fixed bug in Export Favorites feature where it would only allow you to export using the "Browse" button and not directly by typing in a path and filename into the textbox.
- More "friendly" error messages are provided for common errors while exporting favorites (such as invalid filename).
- On tab close, the focus now moves to the right instead of the left.  I mistakenly assumed in version 1.0.7 that in most tabbed programs the focus moved left.  I have found since it moves right in every test case I've tried!  If you prefer the focus to move left, change the parameter OnTabCloseSwitchFocusToTheRight from TRUE to FALSE in the user.config or rdtabs.config files.  This setting is currently not configurable from the GUI.

1.0.7
-----
- Fixed bug where in certain circumstances RD Tabs would incorrectly tell you that saving passwords is disabled by group policy, when policy is actually set NOT to disable the password saving feature.
- Favorites can now be imported and exported from within the Favorites Manager to make it easier to copy favorites from computer to computer.
- When a connection fails, the server will no longer be added to the MRU list.  Also, a parameter is available in the user.config to remove the server from the MRU on any bad connection, even if a connection was established successfully previously (this is disabled by default).  Change RemoveServerFromMRUOnFailure from False to True to change this behavior.  This settings is currently not configurable from the application, only by manually editing the user.config or rdtabs.config files.
- Added a disconnect / cancel connection button which appears when you are opening a new RDP connection.  If you mis-type a server name or something, this will give you the ability to cancel quickly without having to close the entire tab or wait for an error to occur.
- When an error occurs during a connection, the "OK" button in the error dialog now receives focus so you can just hit "enter" to cancel out of the box.
- Fixed bug where under certain circumstances, when you hit enter to cancel a dialog box, the enter key press would be sent to the next control (such as the Connect To dialog) and would immediately initiate another connection.
- When closing a tab, focus will now be sent to the tab immediately to the left of the tab being closed, instead of to the first tab in the list (the previous behavior).  This should provide a better and more consistent user experience similar to other "tabbed" applications.
- Changed the tab-dragging icon to something a little more recognizable and "standardized" (similar to the icon used in IE7) to avoid confusion about what's going on when you drag tabs around.
- Fixed bug where the auto-reconnect feature would not correctly update the status bar and title bar of each tab should network issues cause the remote desktop to attempt to autoreconnect to an active session.  KNOWN ISSUE: The remote desktop screen will not clear after a disconnect during the auto reconnection sequence.  It appears to be a bug in Microsoft's ActiveX control, but I'm not positive.  Either way, this bug is purely cosmetic and does not affect the function of RD Tabs.
- Installer now includes shotcuts to the help file and changelog.txt in the Start Menu.
- Fixed bug where if you installed a newer version of RD Tabs over an older one, then used the same shortcut to launch the application, the help file would not be found since the start location does not include the path where the help file should live.
- Increased size of "Check for Updates" window so that more status messages can be displayed at once by the updater.
- Trapped another undocumented error number thrown by the RDP control.  It would return unknown error code 263 if you click "no" when it asks if you want to connect to a system whose certificate does not match the name you typed in.
- Fixed bug where certain warnings or errors would raise dialog boxes and shift around keyboard focus in such a way that the user would not always know which tab had which problem.  RD Tabs now automatically switches focus to a tab that raises a dialog box.  The dialog boxes are built into the RDP control, otherwise I would replace them with non-modal forms of input, such as the disconnection box.  Unfortunately, I cannot change this behavior.  The best I can do is to automatically switch focus so that the error message is not so confusing.
- Added a close (exit application) button in the menu bar for when RD Tabs is in Full Screen Mode.
- Update URL has been changed to match new Avian Waves website path location.  (Currently both the original and new URLs will work the same.)
- Automatic update notification feature will now check for a new version every 12 hours, in addition to every time the application is opened.  Setting the AutoUpdateRecheckDelay parameter to zero will disable the recheck feature (without disabling autoupdate entirely).  Value is in hours and is currently only modifable in the rdtabs.config or user.config files (no option is in the GUI yet).
- Added better window handle resource consumption detection so that the arbitrary "hard tab limit" is no longer needed (it wasn't really effective anyway).

1.0.6
-----
- First "RTW" release (Released To Web -- analogous to RTM).  Beta test cycle is complete.
- Help was added to the "Help" menu finally.
- An automatic notifcation feature was added to let you know when a newer version of RD Tabs is available.  It can be disabled in the preferences menu.
- Fixed another keyboard focus bug.  This one only seemed to occur if you alt-tabbed out of RD Tabs before ever typing anything into the remote session.
- Fixed bug where RD Tabs would not warn if you selected to "close all tabs" or "close all tabs except active tab."
- Fixed rare bug where RD Tabs would throw a fatal exception when creating a new (non-cached) tab on certain systems.
- Fixed a minor display bug where when you were dragged a tab onto an illegal tab (like the "new tab" tab or the source tab) or outside of the tab line-up, it wouldn't always show the icon to indicate you are dragging the tab onto an invalid location.  This bug had no effect other than offering confusing visual cues.
- A hard cap of 100 concurrent tabs has been added since the RDP ActiveX control (or, perhaps, the interop DLL generated by visual studio) cannot handle more concurrent RDP connections than this.  The cap will prevent RD Tabs from crashing should you ever open that many tabs (my condolences if you do).  You can change this value in the rdtabs.config file in the MaxConcurrentTabs setting.  If your computer blows up after you change it, I take no responsibility!
- Online help is now included!  It's not the greatest in the world (I am not a technical writer), but it should get the job done for now.
- Fixed bug where RD Tabs would not warn you if you attempted to open a favorite in the same tab as an active session with the "close tab" warning enabled.

1.0.5 (Beta)
------------
- Fixed bug where opening a favorite in a new tab would create two new tabs loading the favorite's settings (obviously only one new tab should open).
- Fixed bug where when you used Alt-Tab to switch away from RD Tabs, when you switched back the keyboard would have lost focus and keys could not be sent to the remote server without hitting "tab" to set focus back into the session.
- Fixed bug where When hitting the enter key while on a menu item, if the focus was sent back to the "Connect To" box in the active tab afterwards, it would immediately attempt to connect.
- Fixed duplicate short-cut keys in "Connect To" and "Connection Properties" dialogs.
- Fixed minor typos.
- RD Tabs now respects "Disable Password Saving" group policy in both User and Computer settings, set under the Terminal Services administrative template.  RD Tabs does not yet support any other setting in the administrative template.

1.0.4 (Beta)
------------
- Added ability to optionally save passwords in config file, due to requests.  This is not a safe practice, but can be mitigated through the use of EFS on the user.config file for RD Tabs.
- Fixed bug where when selecting a folder to save a favorite to, the favorite would sometimes be put into the root folder instead.
- Fixed bug where the password was not properly sent to the remote server if specified in the "Connect To" dialog.

1.0.3 (Beta)
------------
- Added a feature to check for newer version of RD Tabs from within application (under the Help menu).
- Added ability to select which folder to save a favorite to when a tab page is saved as a favorite.
- Fixed bug which caused a favorite's servername to be set for the default connection occassionally.
- Fixed bug which could allow multiple favorites to be set at the root folder with the same Display Name (this is different from the other display name bug).
- Fixed bug in Manage Favorites where renaming a favorite could create two or more favorites with the same display name.  This could cause unexpected behavior.
- Fixed bug in Manage Favorites where editing a favorite would not validate portions of input, which could lead to unexpected behavior if invalid input was entered.
- Fixed several minor display bugs.
- Added ability to import settings from RDP files saved by the standard Microsoft RDP client.  Importing can be done in the "Connect To" box in each tab, when creating a Favorite, or when specifying default connection properties.
- Fixed bug where Display Name would not display correctly all of the time when opening a connection by using a saved favorite.
- Fixed bug where Connection menu "Close Active Tab" would prompt to confirm about disconnecting an active session even if the session was disconnected.
- Fixed bug where some "Active Tab" commands did not respond in Connection menu.
- Installer will now uninstall older copies of RD Tabs automatically.
- Installation path (and start menu path) changed to "Avian Waves" to match the "company name" I will be using for this application.  Old configuration files can be imported by copying the user.config into the new Application Data path for Avian WavesRD Tabs.
- RD Tabs now installs its own copy of the Remote Desktop OCX file (version 5.2.3790.1830) for remote desktop connectivity instead of directly interfacing with a pre-installed mstscax.dll.  This seems to fix certain registration problems during installation on certain PCs.  Microsoft's licensing agreement allows redistribution of this file with RD Tabs.  Email approval from Microsoft's licensing department confirms this.  All required components are now distributed with RD Tabs, which should fix many installation problems.  End users must have valid Microsoft licensing with respect to their terminal servers/services and remote desktops since RD Tabs will include a Microsoft component whose license requires this.
- Focus is now sent back to the active RDP session after a dragging a tab, instead of "sticking" in the tabs in some cases.
- Fixed bug where creating a new favorite would not start out with the previously defined Default Connection Properties.
- Attempted to clarify error messages when connections fail or sessions are disconnected unexpectedly.
- Assembly version and application version now match, using the following versioning scheme: Major.Minor.PatchLevel.  Setup file reflects this versioning scheme as well.  When RTM is ready, PatchLevel is incremented and beta flag is dropped.  RTM Version will therefore still upgrade from beta versions without losing settings.
- RD Tabs will import settings from older versions automatically while preserving the state of the older version's settings in case installation is rolled back.

1.0.2 (Beta)
------------
- Added drag and droppable tabs.
- Favorites now supports subfolders.
- Dialog box embedded onto tab page is used instead of the standard modal message boxes to notify a user of error or disconnect status of a tab (was too intrusive and impossible to tell which tab was throwing the error previously).
- Focus automatically switches to the active RDP connection when application gains focus to prevent the sense that they keyboard doesn't work on remote connections at times.  (Beta 1 work-around was to hit the "tab" key until the RDP session was again in focus.)
- Many more window state parameters are saved inbetween sessions to maintain customization.
- Ability to hide the menu bar was added.
- Ability to minimize RD Tabs when in full screen mode was added.
- Preferences menu was created to house all application preferences.  (In beta 1, the settings were scattered around in several places.)
- Ability to hide the connection bar was added.
- Connection menu contains Connect To, Reconnect, Disconnect, and Add to Favorites options for the current tab (useful when connection bar is hidden).
- Preference to disable application warnings was added.
- In a multiple monitor set-up, RD Tabs now remembers which monitor it was last located on, even in full screen mode.
- Registration of required ActiveX RDP DLL is more automated and seemless for the end-user.  (RDP 5.1 and 5.2 are supported.)
- Fixed many minor bugs.

1.0.1 (Beta)
------------
- Preliminary version with only a small subset of features available in the final version.

1.0.0 (Alpha)
-------------
- Proof of concept experiment; Developer build; Never released
